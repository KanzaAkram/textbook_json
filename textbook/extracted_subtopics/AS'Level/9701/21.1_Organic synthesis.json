    "content": "Designing new medicinal drugs\nHow do we go about designing new molecules to fight \ndiseases? One way is to identify the structural features the \nnew drug will need to stop particular bacteria or viruses \nworking. The structural features may be associated with \nthe active site on a particular enzyme needed for an \nessential function of the pathogen. Once these structural \nfeatures have been identified we can then predict the shape \nof a molecule that would fit into, and hence block, the \nactive site.\nThe functional groups present would also be crucial to \nensure the drug could bind into the active site effectively. \nThe intermolecular bonds formed between the drug and \nits target molecule could involve:\n■\n■\nhydrogen bonding\n■\n■\nionic attraction\n■\n■\ndipole–dipole forces\n■\n■\ninstantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces (van der Waals’ \nforces, see Chapter 4, page 62).\nComputers are now used to judge the fit between a \npotential drug molecule and a receptor site on its \ntarget molecule. Such molecular modelling has greatly \nspeeded up the process of designing new medicines. \nThe interactions and fit of a potential medicine with \na biological receptor molecule can be studied before \nthe medicine is ever made in the lab. Before molecular \nmodelling became available, the synthesis of a new \nmedicine involved far more trial and error. Chemists had \nto prepare many more possible medicines for testing. \nWith molecular modelling, only those molecules that \nare definite possibilities are made and tested. Molecular \nmodelling on a computer is now a powerful tool, used \nwhen designing medicines and many other compounds \n(e.g. pesticides and polymers).\nThis type of research was used in the fight against  \nAIDS in the late 1980s and 1990s. Scientists using  \nX-ray crystallography (a method in which a sample is  \nirradiated with X-rays and the pattern is analysed by  \ncomputer) worked out the shape of HIV protease in  \n1988 (Figure 30.2). This enzyme plays an important role \nwhen the virus becomes infectious. Researchers realised \nthat, if a molecule could be discovered that could block \nits active site, this might be one step on the route to \nfinding a cure for AIDS. Knowing the molecule that the \nenzyme worked on (its substrate), researchers were able \nconstruct similar molecules on the computer screen to fit \nthe active site.\nThe first attempts fitted perfectly, but were not water \nsoluble. This meant the drug could not be delivered to its \ntarget, the HIV protease. Eventually a soluble molecule \nthat would interfere with the enzyme was found. In less \nthan 8 years pharmaceutical companies had developed \nthree new anti-viral drugs for people with HIV/AIDS.  \nThis would have taken about twice as long if the structure \nof HIV protease had not been determined. Traditional \nIntroduction\nChemists play a vital role in developing new materials \nto improve our lives. In this chapter you can find out \nabout their work in developing new medicinal drugs.\nFigure 30.1  Chemists around the \nworld work in large teams to model, \ndevelop and test new medicines.\nChapter 30: Organic synthesis\n457\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nactive site\nFigure 30.2  A symmetrical HIV protease molecule, with its \nactive site in the centre of the molecule. Knowing its structure \nmade the search for a drug to fight AIDS much quicker and \ncheaper than traditional trial-and-error methods.\ntrial-and-error methods involve the testing of many \nthousands of possible drugs.\nThe death rate from AIDS dropped significantly. \nHowever, the virus developed resistance to the new drugs \nas it mutated. So scientists now have to model the new \ndrug-resistant strains of the infection and are developing \nnew drugs to inhibit the mutant versions of HIV protease. \nThese inhibitors are one part of a cocktail of drugs that \ncan be used to treat the disease now.\n458\nIdentifying macromolecules\nNMR spectroscopy is also used extensively in finding \nout the structures of biological macromolecules such \nas proteins and nucleic acids. As well as identifying the \ndifferent types of 1H atoms present, more sophisticated \ndata can yield, for example, the distance between atoms in \nmacromolecules. Large amounts of data are collected and \nanalysed by computer programs to reveal the shape of the \nmolecules under investigation.\nFigures 30.3 and 30.4 show images obtained from \nNMR analysis of two protein molecules made up from \nover 100 amino acids. These are called ribbon diagrams.\nFigure 30.3  A protein made up of  \n106 amino acid residues.\n\nFigure 30.4  A protein made up of 153 amino acid residues.\nThis NMR analysis takes place in solution, so it is \nparticularly useful for medical research. Many human \nproteins exist in solution in the body so we can mimic the \ninteractions that take place in cells or in the bloodstream.\nquestion\n1\t \u0007a\t \u0007Which method was used to determine the \nstructure of HIV protease in 1988?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Which method could be used to show the shape of \nthe enzyme in solution?\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007What type of natural polymer is an enzyme such as \nHIV protease?\n\u0007d\t \u0007How did the new anti-viral drugs work?\nChirality in pharmaceutical synthesis\nThe pharmaceutical industry is constantly searching for \nnew drugs. Their research chemists have discovered that \nmost of these drugs contain at least one chiral centre (see \npage 195). Remember that a molecule containing a carbon \natom bonded to four different atoms or groups of atoms \ncan exist as two non-superimposable mirror images. \nThese two isomers are called enantiomers and they will \nbe optically active. They differ in their ability to rotate the \nplane of polarised light to the left or to the right.\nUsing conventional organic reactions to make the \ndesired product will yield a 50 : 50 mixture of the two \nenantiomers. We call this a racemic mixture. Although the \nphysical properties of the enantiomers will be identical, \neach differs in its ‘pharmaceutical activity’, i.e. the effect \nthe drug has on the body. For example, naproxen is a drug\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nused to treat the pain caused by arthritis (Figure 30.5). \nOne enantiomer will ease the pain but the other can cause \nliver damage.\nAs another example, one enantiomer of a drug used  \nto treat tuberculosis (TB) is effective, whereas the  \nother can cause blindness. Therefore, chemists ideally \nneed a single pure enantiomer to put in their drug \nproduct. Note that about 80% of new drugs patented are \nsingle enantiomers.\nUsing pure enantiomers will be beneficial as it:\n■\n■\nreduces the patient’s dosage by half as the pure enantiomer \nis more potent, i.e. has better therapeutic activity (thereby \ncutting costs of production)\n■\n■\nminimises the risk of side effects (thereby protecting \npatients from further problems and drugs companies  \nfrom possible legal action for damages if serious side effects \ndo occur).\nThere are three ways to prepare pure enantiomers:\n■\n■\noptical resolution\n■\n■\nusing optically active starting materials\n■\n■\nusing a chiral catalyst.\nOptical resolution\nThis method involves the chemists following a traditional \nsynthetic route to make the compound, resulting in a \nracemic mixture. Then they separate the two enantiomers \nin a process called optical resolution. This involves using \na pure enantiomer of another optically active compound \n(called a chiral auxiliary) that will react with one of the \nisomers in the mixture. The new product formed will \nnow have different properties and so can be separated \nby physical means. For example, the solubility in a \ngiven solvent will differ so the unwanted enantiomer \nand the new product can be separated by fractional \ncrystallisation. The new product is then converted back \nto the desired enantiomer in a simple reaction (e.g. by \nadding dilute alkali).\nThe crystallisation is repeated many times to ensure \npurity. This method is difficult, time-consuming, uses \nextra reagents and involves the disposal of half the original \nracemic mixture.\nLarge volumes of organic solvents (often harmful \nto the environment) are used in the process. However, \nchemists are now using supercritical carbon dioxide as a \nsolvent, which is much safer. At 31 °C and 73 atmospheres \npressure, CO2 is a suitable non-polar solvent for many \ndrug derivatives in the racemic resolution process. The \nsolubility of the derivatives can be changed, simply by \nvarying the density of the solvent. The solvent, which is\n\nChapter 30: Organic synthesis\nnon-toxic, is easily removed by reducing the pressure and \nthen recycling it to use in the process again.\nWe can also use high-performance liquid \nchromatography (HPLC, see page 436) to separate a \nracemic mixture, as long as the stationary medium (e.g. \nthe solid that packs the column) is itself optically active.\nUsing optically active starting materials\nThis technique uses starting materials that are themselves \noptically active and in the same orientation as the desired \nproduct. These are often naturally occurring compounds \nsuch as carbohydrates or L-amino acids. The biochemist \nwill choose from this ‘chiral pool’. The synthetic route is \ndesigned to keep any intermediates and the final product \nformed in the same enantiomeric form. As a result, there is \nno need to carry out the costly separation process needed \nwhen a racemic mixture is produced.\nChiral catalysts\nChemists are also developing new chiral catalysts that \nensure only one specific enantiomer is formed in a \nreaction. The benefits of these catalysts are that only small \nquantities are needed and they can be used over and \nover again, although the catalyst itself can be expensive. \nA ruthenium (Ru) organometallic catalyst is used in the \nproduction of naproxen (see Figure 30.5).\nOften a combination of optical resolution and \nchiral synthesis is needed in the production of a \npharmaceutically active, pure enantiomer.\n459\nC\nH\nH\nC\nCOOH\n+ H2\nCH3O\norganometallic\nruthenium catalyst\n(a chiral catalyst)\n⎯⎯→\nCH3\nH\nC\n*\nCOOH\nCH3O\nnaproxen\n(drug for arthritis)\nFigure 30.5  The chiral catalyst (an organometallic ruthenium \ncompound) ensures only the desired enantiomer is formed – \nin this case, naproxen for the treatment of arthritis. The chiral \ncentre in naproxen is marked with an asterisk. The marked \ncarbon atom is known as an ‘asymmetric carbon’.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nThe pharmaceutical industry can also use enzymes to \npromote stereoselectivity and produce single-enantiomer \nproducts. The specific shape and the nature of the \nmolecular interactions at the active site of an enzyme \nensure only one enantiomer will be formed (as in living \nthings). The enzymes are often immobilised (fixed in \nplace) on inert supports. This enables the reactants to be \npassed over them without the need to separate the product \nfrom the enzymes after the reaction.\nHowever, it can be expensive isolating enzymes from living \nthings. Using whole organisms, such as bacteria, can reduce \nthis cost. Nowadays, synthetic enzymes can also be made, \ndesigned for a particular synthesis. Therefore a search for a \nsuitable enzyme from the limited pool available from natural \nsources is not always necessary.\nOverall, using an enzyme process might take longer \nto develop than a conventional synthetic route, but \nin the long run the benefits generally outweigh the \ndisadvantages. There are fewer steps needed in the \nsynthesis route, resulting in a ‘greener’ process.\nquestion\n460\n2\t \u0007a\t \u0007Why are pure enantiomers rather than \nracemic mixtures the better option for use as \npharmaceutical drugs from the point of view of:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007a patient\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007a pharmaceutical company?\nalkanes\nH2(g), heat\nunder pressure\nwith nickel\ncatalyst\nultraviolet\nlight with\nhalogen, room\ntemperature\nand pressure\nalkenes\ntreat with HX(aq),\nroom temperature\nand pressure\ndistil from mixture\nof alcohol, conc.\nH2SO4 and KX(s)\nheat with dilute\naqueous alkali\nhot pumice\nand AI2O3\npass alkene and\nsteam over heated\nphosphoric acid catalyst\nunder pressure\nwarm with NaBH4\nin water\nalcohols\nFigure 30.6  Some of the important organic reactions you have to remember.\n\nquestion (continued)\n\u0007b\t \u0007Why are modern enzyme-based processes \nfor manufacturing pure enantiomers more \nsustainable (environmentally friendly) than \ntraditional synthetic routes used by the \npharmaceutical industry?\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Find out why the drug thalidomide resulted in legal \naction against its manufacturer.\nSynthetic routes\nWhen research chemists want to make a new compound, \nthey usually work backwards from the desired compound \nto create a series of reactions, starting with a compound \nextracted from a commonly available raw material. In \nindustry, common starting materials are hydrocarbons \nfrom crude oil and its refining, and compounds extracted \nfrom plants, such as esters from fats and vegetable oils.\nYou will need some of the skills of a research chemist \nwhen tackling questions that involve:\n■\n■\npredicting the reactions of complex molecules you  \nhave never seen before, containing more than one \nfunctional group\n■\n■\nsuggesting a series of reactions to make a given compound \nfrom a given starting compound.\nIn order to be successful in answering these questions, \nyou will need to be familiar with all the reactions and \nconditions of each homologous series mentioned in the \nsyllabus.

For example, for Chapter 16 \nwrite the word ‘Halogenoalkane’ in a box and draw arrows \nradiating out from the box to the products made in their \nreactions, labelling the arrows with other reactants and the \nreaction conditions. Displaying these on a wall and using \ndifferent colours will help you remember them.\nAdding carbon atoms\nSometimes the starting compound from a raw material \ndoes not have enough carbon atoms in its molecules to \nmake the desired product. An extra carbon atom can be \nadded by adding the nitrile functional group, \n C   N. \nRemember that these can be made from halogenoalkanes:\nreflux with ethanolic KCN\nRBr  +  HCN    \n    RCN  +  HBr\nwhere R is an alkyl group, so RCN has an extra  \ncarbon atom.\nquestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007Name the functional groups in the molecules of:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007aspirin\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007paracetamol.\nO\nH\nO\nC\nH\nH\nH\nO\nN\nO\nH\nC\nC\nH\nO\nC\nC\nH\naspirin\nparacetamol\nH\nO\nH\n\u0007b\t \u0007i\t\n\u0007Both the molecules in part a are broken down \nwhen refluxed with dilute hydrochloric acid.
