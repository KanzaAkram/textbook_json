The electrons are organised \ninto different levels of energy, and understanding the \neffects of this arrangement is key to understanding \nchemistry itself. We can also make use of these \nelectron levels. For example, causing an electron to \nmove between energy levels can cause energy to be \nemitted or absorbed. Sometimes, we can see this in \nthe form of light.\nFigure 3.1  Electrons moving between energy levels are the \nsource of this light energy. Chemicals in the tubes are said to \nbe ‘chemiluminescent’.\nSimple electronic structure\nOn page 26 we saw that electrons are arranged outside the \nnucleus in energy levels or quantum shells. These principal \nenergy levels or principal quantum shells (symbol n) are \nnumbered according to how far they are from the nucleus. \nThe lowest energy level, n = 1, is closest to the nucleus, the \nenergy level n = 2 is further out, and so on. The electrons \nin quantum shells further away from the nucleus have \nmore energy and are held less tightly to the nucleus.\nThe arrangement of electrons in an atom is called its \nelectronic structure or electronic configuration. The \nelectronic configurations of lithium, carbon and neon are \nshown in Figure 3.2, together with a shorthand way of \nwriting this structure.\nlithium\nneon\nchlorine\n2,1\n2,8\n2,8,7\nFigure 3.2  The simple electronic structures of lithium, neon \nand chlorine.

The general symbol for ionisation energy is \nΔHi. Its units are kJ mol–1.\nThe symbol for the 1st ionisation energy is ΔHi1. Using \ncalcium as an example:\n1st ionisation energy: Ca(g)  \n  Ca+(g)  +  e–\nΔHi1 = 590 kJ mol–1\nIf a second electron is removed from each ion in a mole of \ngaseous 1+ ions, we call it the 2nd ionisation energy, ΔHi2. \nAgain, using calcium as an example:\n2nd ionisation energy: Ca+(g)  \n  Ca2+(g)  +  e–\nΔHi2 = 1150 kJ mol–1\nRemoval of a third electron from each ion in a mole of \ngaseous 2+ ions is called the 3rd ionisation energy. Again, \nusing calcium as an example:\n3rd ionisation energy: Ca2+(g)  \n  Ca3+(g)  +  e–\nΔHi3 = 4940 kJ mol–1\nWe can continue to remove electrons from an atom until \nonly the nucleus is left. We call this sequence of ionisation \nenergies, successive ionisation energies.\nThe successive ionisation energies for the first 11 \nelements in the Periodic Table are shown in Table 3.2.\nThe data in Table 3.2 shows us that:\n■\n■\nFor each element, the successive ionisation energies \nincrease. This is because the charge on the ion gets \ngreater as each electron is removed. As each electron is \nremoved there is a greater attractive force between the \npositively charged protons in the nucleus and the remaining \nnegatively charged electrons. Therefore more energy is \nneeded to overcome these attractive forces.\n■\n■\nThere is a big difference between some successive \nionisation energies. For nitrogen this occurs between \nthe 5th and 6th ionisation energies. For sodium the first \nbig difference occurs between the 1st and 2nd ionisation \nenergies. These large changes indicate that for the second \nof these two ionisation energies the electron being removed \nis from a principal quantum shell closer to the nucleus.\nFor example, for the 5th ionisation energy of nitrogen,  \nthe electron being removed is from the 2nd principal \nquantum shell. For the 6th ionisation energy of nitrogen, \nthe electron being removed is from the 1st principal \nquantum shell.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n1\nH\n1 310\n2\nHe\n2 370\n5 250\n3\nLi\n 519\n7 300\n11 800\n4\nBe\n 900\n1 760\n14 850\n21 000\n5\nB\n 799\n2 420\n 3 660\n25 000\n32 800\n6\nC\n 1 090\n2 350\n 4 620\n 6 220\n37 800\n47 300\n7\nN\n 1 400\n2 860\n 4 580\n 7 480\n 9 450\n53 300\n64 400\n8\nO\n 1 310\n3 390\n 5 320\n 7 450\n11 000\n13 300\n71 300\n84 100\n9\nF\n 1 680\n3 370\n 6 040\n 8 410\n11 000\n15 200\n17 900\n92 000\n106 000\n10\nNe\n 2 080\n3 950\n 6 150\n 9 290\n12 200\n15 200\n20 000\n23 000\n117 000\n131 400\nTable 3.2  Successive ionisation energies for the first 11 elements in the Periodic Table.\n2\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write equations that describe:\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007the 1st ionisation energy of calcium\n\u0007ii\t \u0007the 3rd ionisation energy of potassium\n\u0007iii\t \u0007the 2nd ionisation energy of lithium\n\u0007iv\t \u0007the 5th ionisation energy of sulfur.\n\u0007b\t \u0007The 2nd ionisation energy of nitrogen is \n2860 kJ mol–1. The 3rd ionisation energy of \nnitrogen is 4590 kJ mol–1. Explain why the 3rd \nionisation energy is higher.\nThree factors that influence ionisation \nenergies\n1  The size of the nuclear charge\nAs the atomic number (number of protons) increases, the \npositive nuclear charge increases. The bigger the positive \ncharge, the greater the attractive force between the nucleus \nand the electrons. So, more energy is needed to overcome \nthese attractive forces if an electron is to be removed.\n■\n■\nIn general, ionisation energy increases as the proton \nnumber increases.\n\nChapter 3: Electrons in atoms\nElectrons removed\nElement\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n11\nNa\n  494\n4 560\n 6 940\n 9 540\n13 400\n16 600\n20 100\n25 500\n 28 900\n141 000\n158 700\n2  Distance of outer electrons from the \nnucleus\nThe force of attraction between positive and negative \ncharges decreases rapidly as the distance between them \nincreases. So, electrons in shells further away from the \nnucleus are less attracted to the nucleus than those closer \nto the nucleus.\nQuestion\n35\n■\n■\nThe further the outer electron shell is from the nucleus, the \nlower the ionisation energy.\n3  Shielding effect of inner electrons\nAs all electrons are negatively charged, they repel each \nother. Electrons in full inner shells repel electrons in outer \nshells. Full inner shells of electrons prevent the full nuclear \ncharge being felt by the outer electrons. This is called \nshielding. The greater the shielding of outer electrons by \nthe inner electron shells, the lower the attractive forces \nbetween the nucleus and the outer electrons.\n■\n■\nThe ionisation energy is lower as the number of full  \nelectron shells between the outer electrons and the  \nnucleus increases.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nInterpreting successive ionisation \nenergies\nFigure 3.4 shows a graph of successive ionisation  \nenergies against the number of electrons removed for \nsodium. A logarithmic scale (to the base 10) is used \nbecause the values of successive ionisation energies have \nsuch a large range.\n5\nlog10 ionisation energy /kJmol–1\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10 11\nNumber of electrons removed\n36\nFigure 3.4  Graph of logarithm (log10) of ionisation energy of \nsodium against the number of electrons removed.\nWe can deduce the following about sodium from  \nFigure 3.4:\n■\n■\nThe first electron removed has a low 1st ionisation energy, \nwhen compared with the rest of the data. It is very easily \nremoved from the atom. It is therefore likely to be a long way \nfrom the nucleus and well shielded by inner electron shells.\n■\n■\nThe second electron is much more difficult to remove than \nthe first electron. There is a big jump in the value of the \nionisation energy. This suggests that the second electron is \nin a shell closer to the nucleus than the first electron. Taken \ntogether, the 1st and 2nd ionisation energies suggest that \nsodium has one electron in its outer shell.\n■\n■\nFrom the second to the ninth electrons removed there is \nonly a gradual change in successive ionisation energies. This \nsuggests that all these eight electrons are in the same shell.\n■\n■\nThe 10th and 11th electrons have extremely high ionisation \nenergies, when compared with the rest of the data. This \nsuggests that they are very close to the nucleus. There must \nbe a very great force of attraction between the nucleus and \nthese electrons and there are no inner electrons to shield \nthem. The large increase in ionisation energy between the \n9th and 10th electrons confirms that the 10th electron is in a \nshell closer to the nucleus than the 9th electron.\nFigure 3.5 shows this arrangement of electrons.\n\n1 electron;\nvery easily\nremoved\n2 electrons;\nvery difficult\nto remove\n8 electrons;\nless easily\nremoved\n11+\nnucleus\nFigure 3.5  The arrangement of electrons in an atom of \nsodium can be deduced from the values of successive \nionisation energies.\nQuestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007The successive ionisation energies of boron are \nshown in Table 3.3.\nIonisation\n1st \n2nd \n3rd \n4th \n5th\nIonisation energy / \nkJ mol–1\n799\n2 420 3 660 25 000 32 800\nTable 3.3  Successive ionisation energies of boron.\ni\t\n\u0007Why is there a large increase between the third \nand fourth ionisation energies?\n\u0007ii\t \u0007Explain how these figures confirm that the \nelectronic structure of boron is 2, 3.\n\u0007b\t \u0007For the element aluminium (Z = 13), draw a \nsketch graph to predict the log10 of the successive \nionisation energies (y-axis) against the number of \nelectrons removed (x-axis).\nWe can use successive ionisation energies in this way to:\n■\n■\npredict or confirm the simple electronic configuration  \nof elements\n■\n■\nconfirm the number of electrons in the outer shell of an \nelement and hence the group to which the element belongs.\nworked example\n1\t The successive ionisation energies, ΔHi, of an element\nX are shown in Table 3.4. Which group in the Periodic \nTable does X belong to?\nWe look for a large jump in the value of the ionisation \nenergy. This occurs between the removal of the \n6th and 7th electrons. So, six electrons have been \nremoved comparatively easily. The removal of the \n7th electron requires about three times the energy \nrequired to remove the 6th electron. So, there must be \nsix electrons in the outer shell of X. So, element X must \nbe in Group 16 of the Periodic Table.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nTable 3.4  The successive ionisation energies of an element X.

Each principal quantum shell \ncontains a different number of subshells. The subshells \nare distinguished by the letters s, p or d. There are also f \nsubshells for elements with more than 57 electrons. Figure \n3.6 shows the subshells for the first four principal quantum\n4d\n5s\nn = 4\n4p\n4s\n3d\nIncreasing energy\nn = 3\n3p\n3s\n2p\nn = 2\n2s\n1s\nn = 1\nshell\nsub-shell\nprincipal quantum\nFigure 3.6  The subshells for the first four principal \nquantum shells.\n\nChapter 3: Electrons in atoms\nNumber of electrons removed\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nΔHi / kJ mol–1\n1 000\n2 260\n3 390\n4 540\n7 010\n8 500\n27 100\n31 670\n36 580\n43 140\nlevels. In any principal quantum shell, the energy of the \nelectrons in the subshells increases in the order s < p < d.\nThe maximum number of electrons that are allowed  \nin each subshell is: s = 2 electrons, p = 6 electrons,  \nd = 10 electrons.\n■\n■\nThe first principal quantum level, n = 1, can hold a maximum \nof 2 electrons in an s subshell.\n■\n■\nThe second principal quantum level, n = 2, can hold a \nmaximum of 8 electrons: 2 electrons in the s subshell and  \n6 electrons in the p subshell.\n■\n■\nThe third principal quantum level, n = 3, can hold a maximum \nof 18 electrons: 2 electrons in the s subshell, 6 electrons in the  \np subshell and 10 electrons in the d subshell.\nYou will also notice from Figure 3.6 that the order of  \nthe subshells in terms of increasing energy does not  \nfollow a regular pattern of s then p then d after the \nelement argon. The order of subshells after argon appears \nto overlap. The next element after argon is potassium. \nPotassium’s outer electron is in the 4s, not in the 3d, \nsubshell. The first element with an electron in the 3d \nsubshell is element 21, scandium.\nWhen high-speed electrons hit gas particles at low \npressure, coloured lines are seen through an instrument \ncalled a spectroscope. The letters s, p and d come from \nthe terms used to describe these lines: s for ‘sharp’, p for \n‘principal’ and ‘d for ‘diffuse’.\n37\nAtomic orbitals\nEach subshell contains one or more atomic orbitals.\nAn atomic orbital is a region of space around the nucleus \nof an atom that can be occupied by one or two electrons.\nAs each orbital can only hold a maximum of two electrons, \nthe number of orbitals in each subshell must be:\ns – one orbital\np – three orbitals\nd – five orbitals.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nShapes of the orbitals\nEach orbital has a three-dimensional shape. Within this \nshape there is a high probability of finding the electron or \nelectrons in the orbital. Figure 3.7 shows how we represent \nthe s and p orbitals.\nnormally drawn as\na\ns orbitals\nnormally drawn as\nz\ny\nx\nb\np orbitals\nFigure 3.7  Representations of orbitals (the position of the \nnucleus is shown by the black dot): a  s orbitals are spherical; \nb  p orbitals, px, py and pz, have ‘lobes’ along the x, y and  \nz axes.\n38\nAn s orbital has a spherical shape. The 2s orbital in the \nsecond principal quantum shell has the same shape as \nthe 1s orbital in the first quantum shell. They are both \nspherical, but electrons in the 2s orbital have more energy \nthan electrons in the 1s orbital. There are three 2p orbitals \nin the second quantum shell. Each of these has the same \nshape. The shape is like an hourglass with two ‘lobes’. The \nthree sets of ‘lobes’ are arranged at right angles to each \nother along the x, y and z axes. Hence the three 2p orbitals \nare named 2px, 2py and 2pz. The three 2p orbitals have the \nsame energy as each other. There are also three 3p orbitals \nin the third quantum shell. Their shapes are similar to the \nshapes of the 2p orbitals.\nThe d orbitals are more complex in shape and \narrangement in space. In 1925 Louis de Broglie  \nsuggested that electrons behaved like waves. This led \nto the idea of electron probability clouds. The electron \nprobability cloud for one type of d orbital is very strange – \nit is like a modified p orbital with a ring around the middle \n(Figure 3.8). You will not need to know the d-orbital \nshapes at AS level, but you will for A level when studying \nthe transition elements (see Chapter 24).\n\nFigure 3.8  The shape of a dz2 orbital.\nFilling the shells and orbitals\nThe most stable electronic configuration (electronic \nstructure) of an atom is the one that has the lowest amount \nof energy. The order in which the subshells are filled \ndepends on their relative energy. The subshell with the \nlowest energy, the 1s, is therefore filled first, followed by \nthose that are successively higher in energy. As we noted in \nFigure 3.6, the order of the subshells in terms of increasing \nenergy does not follow a regular pattern of s then p then d \nafter argon, where the 3p subshell is full.

(We imagine an electron rotating around its own \naxis either in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction.)\n■\n■\nWhen there are two electrons in an orbital, the ‘spins’ of the \nelectrons are opposite, so the two arrows in this box point in \nopposite directions.\n2p\n2s\n1s\nFigure 3.11  The electronic configuration of boron in  \nbox form.\nElectrons in the same region of space repel each other \nbecause they have the same charge. So wherever possible, \nelectrons will occupy separate orbitals in the same subshell \nto minimise this repulsion. These electrons have their \n‘spin’ in the same direction. Electrons are only paired \nwhen there are no more empty orbitals available within \na subshell. The spins are then opposite to minimise \nrepulsion. Figure 3.12 shows the electronic structures of \ncarbon, nitrogen and oxygen to illustrate these points.",
