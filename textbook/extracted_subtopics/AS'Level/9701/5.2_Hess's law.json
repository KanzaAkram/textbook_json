This is called the First Law \nof Thermodynamics.\nThis law also applies to chemical reactions. The total \nenergy of the chemicals and their surroundings must \nremain constant. In 1840 Germain Hess applied the Law of \nConservation of Energy to enthalpy changes.\nHess’s law states that ‘the total enthalpy change in a \nchemical reaction is independent of the route by which \nthe chemical reaction takes place as long as the initial and \nfinal conditions are the same’.\nEnthalpy cycles\nWe can illustrate Hess’s law by drawing enthalpy cycles \n(Hess cycles). In Figure 6.7, the reactants A and B combine \ndirectly to form C. This is the direct route.\nTwo indirect routes are also shown. One other way \nof changing A + B to C is to convert A + B into different \nsubstances F + G (intermediates), which then combine to \nform C.\nF + G\nr\nt\nc\no\ne\nu\nr\nt\ni\ne\nd\nn\n1\ni\ndirect route\nA + B\nC\ni\nn\nd\n2\ni\nr\ne\ne\nc\nt\nu\nt\nr\no\nX\nY + Z\nFigure 6.7  The enthalpy change is the same no matter which \nroute is followed.\nHess’s law tells us that the enthalpy change of reaction \nfor the direct route is the same as for the indirect route. It \ndoes not matter how many steps there are in the indirect \nroute. We can still use Hess’s law.\nWe can use Hess’s law to calculate enthalpy  \nchanges that cannot be found by experiments using \ncalorimetry. For example, the enthalpy change of \nformation of propane cannot be found by direct \nexperiment because hydrogen does not react with  \ncarbon under standard conditions.\n\nChapter 6: Enthalpy changes\nEnthalpy change of reaction \nfrom enthalpy changes of \nformation\nWe can calculate the enthalpy change of reaction by using \nthe type of enthalpy cycle shown in Figure 6.8.\n∆Hr\nproducts\nreactants\n∆H2\n∆H1\nelements\nFigure 6.8  An enthalpy cycle for calculating an enthalpy \nchange of reaction. The dashed line shows the indirect (two-\nstep) route.\nWe use the enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants \nand products to calculate the enthalpy change of the \nreaction. we take note of the directions of the arrows to \nfind the one-stage (direct) and two-stage (indirect) routes. \nWhen we use Hess’s law we see that:\nΔH2 \t\n= \nΔH1   +  ΔHr\n\t direct route\t\n\t\nindirect route\n97\nSo ΔHr = ΔH2 – ΔH1\nTo calculate the enthalpy change of reaction using this \ntype of enthalpy cycle we use the following procedure:\n■\n■\nwrite the balanced equation at the top\n■\n■\ndraw the cycle with elements at the bottom\n■\n■\ndraw in all arrows, making sure they go in the  \ncorrect directions\n■\n■\napply Hess’s law, taking into account the number of moles \nof each reactant and product.\nIf there are 3 moles of a product, e.g. 3CO2(g), we must \nmultiply the enthalpy change of formation by 3.

Breaking bonds requires energy. The energy \nis needed to overcome the attractive forces joining the \natoms together. Energy is released when new bonds are \nformed. Bond breaking is endothermic and bond forming \nis exothermic.\nIn a chemical reaction:\n■\n■\nif the energy needed to break bonds is less than the energy \nreleased when new bonds are formed, the reaction will \nrelease energy and is exothermic.",
