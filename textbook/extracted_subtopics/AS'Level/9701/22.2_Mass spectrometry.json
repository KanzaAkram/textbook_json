    "content": "the relative atomic mass of the element very accurately. \nTo find the necessary data we use an instrument called a \nmass spectrometer (see box on mass spectrometry).\nRelative molecular mass, Mr\nThe relative molecular mass of a compound (Mr) is the \nrelative mass of one molecule of the compound on a  \nscale where the carbon-12 isotope has a mass of exactly  \n12 units. We find the relative molecular mass by adding  \nup the relative atomic masses of all the atoms present in \nthe molecule.\nFor example, for methane:\nformula\t\nCH4\natoms present\t\n1 × C; 4 × H\nadd Ar values\t\n(1 × Ar[C]) + (4 × Ar[H])\nMr of methane\t\n= (1 × 12.0) + (4 × 1.0)\n\t\n= 16.0\nRelative formula mass\nFor compounds containing ions we use the term relative \nformula mass. This is calculated in the same way as for \nrelative molecular mass. It is also given the same symbol, \nMr. For example, for magnesium hydroxide:\nformula\t\nMg(OH)2\nions present\t\n1 × Mg2+; 2 × (OH–)\nadd Ar values\t\n(1 × Ar[Mg]) + (2 × (Ar[O] + Ar[H]))\nMr of magnesium \nhydroxide\t\n= \t(1 × 24.3) + (2 × (16.0 + 1.0))\n\t\n= 58.3\nquestion\n1\t \u0007Use the Periodic Table on page 473 to calculate the \nrelative formula masses of the following:\n\u0007a\t \u0007calcium chloride, CaCl2\n\t\n\u0007b\t \u0007copper(II) sulfate, CuSO4\n\t\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007ammonium sulfate, (NH4)2SO4\n\t\n\u0007d\t \u0007magnesium nitrate-6-water, Mg(NO3)2.6H2O\nHint: for part d you need to calculate the mass of \nwater separately and then add it to the Mr of Mg(NO3)2.\n\nChapter 1: Moles and equations\nAccurate relative atomic masses\nMass spectrometry\nbox 1.1: Biological drawing\nA mass spectrometer (Figure 1.2) can be used \nto measure the mass of each isotope present \nin an element. It also compares how much of \neach isotope is present – the relative abundance \n(isotopic abundance). A simplified diagram of a \nmass spectrometer is shown in Figure 1.3. You will \nnot be expected to know the details of how a mass \nspectrometer works, but it is useful to understand \nhow the results are obtained.\n3\nFigure 1.2  A mass spectrometer is a large and complex \ninstrument.\nvaporised sample\npositively charged \nelectrodes accelerate positive ions\nmagnetic field\nheated\nfilament\nproduces\nhigh-energy\nelectrons\nionisation\nchamber\nflight tube\nion\ndetector\nrecorder\ncomputer\nFigure 1.3  Simplified diagram of a mass spectrometer.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nMass spectrometry (continued)\nThe atoms of the element in the vaporised sample \nare converted into ions. The stream of ions is \nbrought to a detector after being deflected (bent) \nby a strong magnetic field. As the magnetic field is \nincreased, the ions of heavier and heavier isotopes \nare brought to the detector. The detector is \nconnected to a computer, which displays the  \nmass spectrum.\nThe mass spectrum produced shows the relative \nabundance (isotopic abundance) on the vertical \naxis and the mass to ion charge ratio (m/e) on the \nhorizontal axis. Figure 1.4 shows a typical mass \nspectrum for a sample of lead.

To calculate the relative atomic mass we follow \nthis method:\n■\n■\nmultiply each isotopic mass by its percentage abundance\n■\n■\nadd the figures together\n■\n■\ndivide by 100.\nWe can use this method to calculate the relative atomic \nmass of neon from its mass spectrum, shown in Figure 1.5.\nThe mass spectrum of neon has three peaks:\n20Ne (90.9%), 21Ne (0.3%) and 22Ne (8.8%).\nAr of neon\n=  ​ (20 × 90.9) + (21.0 × 0.3) + (22 × 8.8) \n \n \n_______________________________ \n \n100 \n​ = 20.2\nNote that this answer is given to 3 significant figures, \nwhich is consistent with the data given.\n90.9%\n100\n80\nRelative abundance/ %\n60\n40\n20\n8.8 %\n0.3 %\n0\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\nMass/charge (m/e) ratio\nFigure 1.5  The mass spectrum of neon, Ne.\nA high-resolution mass spectrometer can give very \naccurate relative isotopic masses. For example 16O = 15.995 \nand 32S = 31.972. Because of this, chemists can distinguish \nbetween molecules such as SO2 and S2, which appear to \nhave the same relative molecular mass.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nquestion\n2\t \u0007Look at the mass spectrum of germanium, Ge.\n36.7 %\n7.7%\n40\n27.4%\n30\n20.6%\nAbundance /%\n20\n7.6%\n10\n0\nMass/charge (m/e) ratio\n80\n75\n70\nFigure 1.6  The mass spectrum of germanium.\n\u0007a\t \u0007Write the isotopic formula for the heaviest isotope \nof germanium.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Use the % abundance of each isotope to calculate \nthe relative atomic mass of germanium.\nAmount of substance\nThe mole and the Avogadro constant\nThe formula of a compound shows us the number of \natoms of each element present in one formula unit or one \nmolecule of the compound. In water we know that two \natoms of hydrogen (Ar = 1.0) combine with one atom of \noxygen (Ar = 16.0). So the ratio of mass of hydrogen atoms \nto oxygen atoms in a water molecule is 2 : 16. No matter \nhow many molecules of water we have, this ratio will \nalways be the same. But the mass of even 1000 atoms is  \nfar too small to be weighed. We have to scale up much \nmore than this to get an amount of substance that is easy \nto weigh.\nThe relative atomic mass or relative molecular mass of \na substance in grams is called a mole of the substance. So a \nmole of sodium (Ar = 23.0) weighs 23.0 g. The abbreviation \nfor a mole is mol. We define the mole in terms of the \nstandard carbon-12 isotope (see page 28).\nOne mole of a substance is the amount of that substance \nthat has the same number of specific particles (atoms, \nmolecules or ions) as there are atoms in exactly 12 g of the \ncarbon-12 isotope.\n\nChapter 1: Moles and equations\nWe often refer to the mass of a mole of substance as its \nmolar mass (abbreviation M). The units of molar mass  \nare g mol–1.\nThe number of atoms in a mole of atoms is very large: \n6.02 × 1023 atoms. This number is called the Avogadro \nconstant (or Avogadro number). The symbol for the \nAvogadro constant is L (the symbol NA may also be used). \nThe Avogadro constant applies to atoms, molecules, ions \nand electrons. So in 1 mole of sodium there are 6.02 × 1023 \nsodium atoms and in 1 mole of sodium chloride (NaCl) there \nare 6.02 × 1023 sodium ions and 6.02 × 1023 chloride ions.\nIt is important to make clear what type of particles \nwe are referring to. If we just state ‘moles of chlorine’, it is \nnot clear whether we are thinking about chlorine atoms \nor chlorine molecules. A mole of chlorine molecules, Cl2, \ncontains 6.02 × 1023 chlorine molecules but twice as many \nchlorine atoms, as there are two chlorine atoms in every \nchlorine molecule.\n5\nFigure 1.7  Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856) was an Italian \nscientist who first deduced that equal volumes of gases \ncontain equal numbers of molecules. Although the Avogadro \nconstant is named after him, it was left to other scientists to \ncalculate the number of particles in a mole.\nMoles and mass\nThe Système International (SI) base unit for mass is the \nkilogram. But this is a rather large mass to use for general \nlaboratory work in chemistry. So chemists prefer to use  \nthe relative molecular mass or formula mass in grams \n(1000 g = 1 kg). You can find the number of moles of a \nsubstance by using the mass of substance and the relative \natomic mass (Ar) or relative molecular mass (Mr).\nnumber of moles (mol) = ​  mass of substance in grams (g) \n \n \n__________________________ \n \nmolar mass (g mol–1) \n​\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nworked example\n1\t How many moles of sodium chloride are present in \n117.0 g of sodium chloride, NaCl?\n(Ar values: Na = 23.0, Cl = 35.5)\nmolar mass of NaCl\t=\t23.0 + 35.5\n=\t58.5 g mol–1\nnumber of moles\t\n=\t​ \nmass \n___________ \nmolar mass ​\n=\t​ 117.0 \n_____ \n58.5  ​\n=\t2.0 mol\n6\nFigure 1.8  From left to right, one mole of each of copper, \nbromine, carbon, mercury and lead.\nquestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007Use these Ar values (Fe = 55.8, N = 14.0, O = 16.0, \nS = 32.1) to calculate the amount of substance in \nmoles in each of the following:\n\u0007i\t\n\u000710.7 g of sulfur atoms\n\u0007ii\t \u000764.2 g of sulfur molecules (S8)\n\u0007iii\t \u000760.45 g of anhydrous iron(III) nitrate, Fe(NO3)3.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Use the value of the Avogadro constant (6.02 × \n1023 mol–1) to calculate the total number of atoms in \n7.10 g of chlorine atoms.

To calculate this we need to know \nthe chemical equation. This shows us the ratio of moles \nof the reactants and products – the stoichiometry of the \nequation. The balanced equation shows this stoichiometry. \nFor example, in the reaction\nFe2O3  +  3CO  \n  2Fe  +  3CO2\n1 mole of iron(III) oxide reacts with 3 moles of carbon \nmonoxide to form 2 moles of iron and 3 moles of carbon \ndioxide. The stoichiometry of the equation is 1 : 3 : 2 : 3.  \nThe large numbers that are included in the equation  \n(3, 2 and 3) are called stoichiometric numbers.\nIn order to find the mass of products formed in a \nchemical reaction we use:\n■\n■\nthe mass of the reactants\n■\n■\nthe molar mass of the reactants\n■\n■\nthe balanced equation.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nFigure 1.9  Iron reacting with sulfur to produce iron sulfide. \nWe can calculate exactly how much iron is needed to react \nwith sulfur and the mass of the products formed by  \nknowing the molar mass of each reactant and the balanced \nchemical equation.\nworked example\n3\t Magnesium burns in oxygen to form magnesium oxide.\n2Mg  +  O2  \n  2MgO\nWe can calculate the mass of oxygen needed to react \nwith 1 mole of magnesium. We can calculate the mass \nof magnesium oxide formed.\nStep 1  Write the balanced equation.\nStep 2  Multiply each formula mass in g by the \nrelevant stoichiometric number in the equation.\n2Mg\t\n+\t\nO2\t\n \n \t\n2MgO\n\t 2 × 24.3 g\t\n\t 1 × 32.0 g\t\n\t\n2 × (24.3 g  +  16.0 g)\n\t\n48.6 g\t\n\t\n32.0 g\t\n\t\n80.6 g\nFrom this calculation we can deduce that:\n■\n■\n32.0 g of oxygen are needed to react exactly with \n48.6 g of magnesium\n■\n■\n80.6 g of magnesium oxide are formed.\nIf we burn 12.15 g of magnesium (0.5 mol) we get \n20.15 g of magnesium oxide. This is because the \nstoichiometry of the reaction shows us that for every \nmole of magnesium burnt we get the same number of \nmoles of magnesium oxide.\nIn this type of calculation we do not always need to know \nthe molar mass of each of the reactants. If one or more of \nthe reactants is in excess, we need only know the mass in \ngrams and the molar mass of the reactant that is not in \nexcess (the limiting reactant).\n\nChapter 1: Moles and equations\nworked example\n4\t Iron(III) oxide reacts with carbon monoxide to form \niron and carbon dioxide.\nFe2O3  +  3CO  \n  2Fe  +  3CO2\nCalculate the maximum mass of iron produced when \n798 g of iron(III) oxide is reduced by excess carbon \nmonoxide.\n\t\n(Ar values: Fe = 55.8, O = 16.0)\nStep 1\t Fe2O3  +  3CO  \n  2Fe  +  3CO2\n\t\nStep 2\t 1 mole iron(III) oxide \t\n 2 moles iron\n(2 × 55.8) + (3 × 16.0) \t\n 2 × 55.8\n159.6 g Fe2O3 \t \t\n 111.6 g Fe\nStep 3\t 798 g\t\n​ 111.6 \n_____ \n159.6 ​ × 798\n= 558 g Fe\nYou can see that in step 3, we have simply used ratios \nto calculate the amount of iron produced from 798 g of \niron(III) oxide.\nquestion\n7\n5\t \u0007a\t \u0007Sodium reacts with excess oxygen to form sodium \nperoxide, Na2O2.\n2Na  +  O2  \n  Na2O2\n\u0007Calculate the maximum mass of sodium  \nperoxide formed when 4.60 g of sodium is burnt  \nin excess oxygen.\n\t\n\t\n(Ar values: Na = 23.0, O = 16.0)\n\u0007b\t \u0007Tin(IV) oxide is reduced to tin by carbon.

Give your answer to 3 \nsignificant figures.\n\t\n\t\n(Ar values: C = 12.0, O = 16.0, Sn = 118.7)\nThe stoichiometry of a reaction\nWe can find the stoichiometry of a reaction if we know the \namounts of each reactant that exactly react together and \nthe amounts of each product formed.\nFor example, if we react 4.0 g of hydrogen with 32.0 g of \noxygen we get 36.0 g of water. (Ar values: H = 1.0, O = 16.0)\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nhydrogen (H2)  +  \toxygen (O2)  \n  \twater (H2O)\n​  4.0 \n______ \n2 × 1.0 ​\t\n​  32.0 \n_______ \n2 × 16.0 ​\t\n​ \n36.0 \n_____________ \n \n(2 × 1.0) + 16.0\n ​\t\n= 2 mol\t\n= 1 mol\t\n= 2 mol\nThis ratio is the ratio of stoichiometric numbers in the \nequation. So the equation is:\n2H2  +  O2  \n  2H2O\nWe can still deduce the stoichiometry of this reaction \neven if we do not know the mass of oxygen that reacted. \nThe ratio of hydrogen to water is 1 : 1. But there is only one \natom of oxygen in a molecule of water – half the amount \nin an oxygen molecule. So the mole ratio of oxygen to \nwater in the equation must be 1 : 2.\nQuestion\n6\t \u000756.2 g of silicon, Si, reacts exactly with 284.0 g of \nchlorine, Cl2, to form 340.2 g of silicon(IV) chloride, \nSiCl4.

The examples show \nthe number 526.84 rounded up to varying numbers of \nsignificant figures.\nrounded to 4 significant figures = 526.8\nrounded to 3 significant figures = 527\nrounded to 2 significant figures = 530\nWhen you are writing an answer to a calculation, the \nanswer should be to the same number of significant figures \nas the least number of significant figures in the data.\nworked example\n5\t How many moles of calcium oxide are there in 2.9 g of \ncalcium oxide?\n(Ar values: Ca = 40.1, O = 16.0)\nIf you divide 2.9 by 56.1, your calculator shows \n0.051 693 …. The least number of significant figures \nin the data, however, is 2 (the mass is 2.9 g). So your \nanswer should be expressed to 2 significant figures,  \nas 0.052 mol.\n\nworked example (continued)\nNote 1  Zeros before a number are not significant \nfigures.

This is called Avogadro’s hypothesis. This \nidea is approximately true as long as the pressure is not \ntoo high or the temperature too low. It is convenient to \nmeasure volumes of gases at room temperature (20 °C) \nand pressure (1 atmosphere). At room temperature and \npressure (r.t.p.) one mole of any gas has a volume of \n24.0 dm3. So, 24.0 dm3 of carbon dioxide and 24.0 dm3 of \nhydrogen both contain one mole of gas molecules.\nWe can use the molar gas volume of 24.0 dm3 at r.t.p.  \nto find:\n■\n■\nthe volume of a given mass or number of moles of gas\n■\n■\nthe mass or number of moles of a given volume of gas.\n\nworked examples\n22\t \u0007Calculate the volume of 0.40 mol of nitrogen at r.t.p.\n(volume (in dm3)\t= 24.0 × number of moles of gas\nvolume\t\n= 24.0 × 0.40\n\t\n\t\n= 9.6 dm3\n23\t Calculate the mass of methane, CH4, present in \n120 cm3 of methane.\n(Mr value: methane = 16.0)\n120 cm3 is 0.120 dm3 ​( ​ 120 \n_____ \n1000 ​ = 0.120 )​\nmoles of methane\t= ​ volume of methane (dm3) \n \n______________________ \n \n24.0 \n​\n= ​ 0.120 \n_____ \n24.0 ​\n= 5 × 10–3 mol\nmass of methane\t = 5 × 10–3 × 16.0\n= 0.080 g methane\nQuestion\n19\t \u0007a\t \u0007Calculate the volume, in dm3, occupied by 26.4 g of \ncarbon dioxide at r.t.p.\n(Ar values: C = 12.0, O = 16.0)\n\u0007b\t \u0007A flask of volume 120 cm3 is filled with helium gas \nat r.t.p.

If we mix 20 cm3 \nof hydrogen with 10 cm3 of oxygen and explode the \nmixture, we will find that the gases have exactly reacted \ntogether and no hydrogen or oxygen remains.

Over time, a model was \ndeveloped in which all substances were composed \nof atoms of elements. Originally it was thought that \natoms could not themselves be broken up into yet \nsmaller parts, but now we understand the structure \ninside the atoms themselves, and the role of electrons, \nprotons and neutrons. We can now design and make \nmaterials and objects almost at the atomic level.\nNanotechnology is the design and making of objects \nthat may have a thickness of only a few thousand \natoms or less. Groups of atoms can be moved around \non special surfaces. In this way scientists hope to \ndevelop tiny machines that may help deliver medical \ndrugs to exactly where they are needed in the body.\nElements and atoms\nEvery substance in our world is made up from chemical \nelements. These chemical elements cannot be broken down \nfurther into simpler substances by chemical means. A few \nelements, such as nitrogen and gold, are found on their \nown in nature, not combined with other elements. Most \nelements, however, are found in combination with other \nelements as compounds.\nEvery element has its own chemical symbol. The \nsymbols are often derived from Latin or Greek words. \nSome examples are shown in Table 2.1.\nElement\nSymbol\ncarbon\nC\nlithium\nLi (from Greek ‘lithos’)\niron\nFe (from Latin ‘ferrum’)\npotassium\nK (from Arabic ‘al-qualyah’ or from the \nLatin ‘kalium’)\nTable 2.1  Some examples of chemical symbols.\nChemical elements contain only one type of atom. An \natom is the smallest part of an element that can take part \nin a chemical change. Atoms are very small. The diameter \nof a hydrogen atom is approximately 10–10 m, so the mass \nof an atom must also be very small. A single hydrogen \natom weighs only 1.67 × 10–27 kg.\n\nChapter 2: Atomic structure\nFigure 2.1  Each of the blue peaks in this image is an \nindividual molecule. The molecules can be moved over \na copper surface, making this a molecular abacus or  \ncounting device.\n25\nFigure 2.2  Our Sun is made largely of the elements hydrogen \nand helium. This is a composite image made using X-ray and \nsolar optical telescopes.\nInside the atom\nThe structure of an atom\nEvery atom has nearly all of its mass concentrated in a \ntiny region in the centre of the atom called the nucleus. \nThe nucleus is made up of particles called nucleons. There\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nare two types of nucleon: protons and neutrons. Atoms of \ndifferent elements have different numbers of protons.\nOutside the nucleus, particles called electrons move \naround in regions of space called orbitals (see page 37). \nChemists often find it convenient to use a model of the \natom in which electrons move around the nucleus in \nelectron shells. Each shell is a certain distance from the \nnucleus at its own particular energy level (see page 37). \nIn a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the \nnumber of protons. A simple model of a carbon atom is \nshown in Figure 2.3.\nelectron\nnucleus\nelectron shells\n(energy levels)\nneutron\nproton\n26\nFigure 2.3  A model of a carbon atom. This model is not very \naccurate but it is useful for understanding what happens to \nthe electrons during chemical reactions.\nExperiments with subatomic particles\nWe can deduce the electric charge of subatomic \nparticles by showing how beams of electrons, \nprotons and neutrons behave in electric fields. If we \nfire a beam of electrons past electrically charged \nplates, the electrons are deflected (bent) away from \nthe negative plate and towards the positive plate \n(Figure 2.5a). This shows us that the electrons are \nnegatively charged.\nA cathode-ray tube (Figure 2.5b) can be used to \nproduce beams of electrons. At one end of the tube\na\n–\nelectron\nbeam\n+\n\nAtoms are tiny, but the nucleus of an atom is far tinier \nstill. If the diameter of an atom were the size of a football \nstadium, the nucleus would only be the size of a pea. This \nmeans that most of the atom is empty space! Electrons are \neven smaller than protons and neutrons.\nFigure 2.4  Ernest Rutherford (left) and Hans Geiger (right) \nusing their alpha-particle apparatus.

At \nthe other end of the tube is a fluorescent screen, \nwhich glows when electrons hit it.\nThe electrons are given off from the heated wire and \nare attracted towards two metal plates, which are \npositively charged. As they pass through the metal \nplates the electrons form a beam. When the electron \nbeam hits the screen a spot of light is produced. \nWhen an electric field is applied across this beam \nthe electrons are deflected (bent). The fact that the \nelectrons are so easily attracted to the positively \ncharged anode and that they are easily deflected by \nan electric field shows us that:\n■\n■\nelectrons have a negative charge\n■\n■\nelectrons have a very small mass.\nFigure 2.6  J.

The \nresults of these experiments show that:\n■\t a proton beam is deflected away from a positively \ncharged plate; as like charges repel, the protons must \nhave a positive charge (Figure 2.7)\n■\t an electron beam is deflected towards a positively \ncharged plate; as unlike charges attract, the electrons \nmust have a negative charge\n■\t a beam of neutrons is not deflected; this is because \nthey are uncharged.\nprotons detected on\nwalls of apparatus\n–\n+\n+\nbeam of\nprotons\n27\n+\nFigure 2.7  A beam of protons is deflected away from a \npositively charged area. This shows us that protons have \na positive charge.\nIn these experiments, huge voltages have to be \nused to show the deflection of the proton beam. \nThis contrasts with the very low voltages needed \nto show the deflection of an electron beam. These \nexperiments show us that protons are much heavier \nthan electrons. If we used the same voltage to \ndeflect electrons and protons, the beam of electrons \nwould have a far greater deflection than the beam \nof protons. This is because a proton is about 2000 \ntimes as heavy as an electron.\n\u0007a\t \u0007What deflection would you expect, if any, when the \nexperiment is repeated with beams of i protons and  \nii neutrons?

The values of these are too small  \nto be very useful when discussing general chemical \nproperties. For example, the charge on a single electron  \nis –1.602 × 10–19 coulombs.

It is also known as the atomic \nnumber. Every atom of the same element has the same \nnumber of protons in its nucleus. It is the proton number \nthat makes an atom what it is. For example, an atom with \na proton number of 11 must be an atom of the element \nsodium. The Periodic Table of elements is arranged in order \nof the proton numbers of the individual elements  \n(see Appendix 1, page 473).\nThe nucleon number (A) is the number of protons plus \nneutrons in the nucleus of an atom. This is also known as \nthe mass number.\n28\nHow many neutrons?\nWe can use the nucleon number and proton number to find \nthe number of neutrons in an atom. As:\nnucleon number = number of protons + number of neutrons\nThen:\nnumber of neutrons\t = nucleon number – number of protons\n\t\n= A – Z\nFor example, an atom of aluminium has a nucleon number \nof 27 and a proton number of 13. So an aluminium atom \nhas 27 – 13 = 14 neutrons.\n\nQuestion\n2\t \u0007Use the information in the table to deduce the number \nof electrons and neutrons in a neutral atom of:\n\u0007a\t \u0007vanadium\n\u0007b\t \u0007strontium\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007phosphorus.\nAtom\nNucleon number\nProton number\nvanadium\n51\n23\nstrontium\n84\n38\nphosphorus\n31\n15\nIsotopes\nAll atoms of the same element have the same number of \nprotons. However, they may have different numbers of \nneutrons. Atoms of the same element that have differing \nnumbers of neutrons are called isotopes.\nIsotopes are atoms of the same element with different \nnucleon (mass) numbers.\nIsotopes of a particular element have the same chemical \nproperties because they have the same number of \nelectrons. They have slightly different physical properties, \nsuch as small differences in density.\nWe can write symbols for isotopes.

The electrons are organised \ninto different levels of energy, and understanding the \neffects of this arrangement is key to understanding \nchemistry itself. We can also make use of these \nelectron levels. For example, causing an electron to \nmove between energy levels can cause energy to be \nemitted or absorbed. Sometimes, we can see this in \nthe form of light.\nFigure 3.1  Electrons moving between energy levels are the \nsource of this light energy. Chemicals in the tubes are said to \nbe ‘chemiluminescent’.\nSimple electronic structure\nOn page 26 we saw that electrons are arranged outside the \nnucleus in energy levels or quantum shells. These principal \nenergy levels or principal quantum shells (symbol n) are \nnumbered according to how far they are from the nucleus. \nThe lowest energy level, n = 1, is closest to the nucleus, the \nenergy level n = 2 is further out, and so on. The electrons \nin quantum shells further away from the nucleus have \nmore energy and are held less tightly to the nucleus.\nThe arrangement of electrons in an atom is called its \nelectronic structure or electronic configuration.

The general symbol for ionisation energy is \nΔHi. Its units are kJ mol–1.\nThe symbol for the 1st ionisation energy is ΔHi1. Using \ncalcium as an example:\n1st ionisation energy: Ca(g)  \n  Ca+(g)  +  e–\nΔHi1 = 590 kJ mol–1\nIf a second electron is removed from each ion in a mole of \ngaseous 1+ ions, we call it the 2nd ionisation energy, ΔHi2. \nAgain, using calcium as an example:\n2nd ionisation energy: Ca+(g)  \n  Ca2+(g)  +  e–\nΔHi2 = 1150 kJ mol–1\nRemoval of a third electron from each ion in a mole of \ngaseous 2+ ions is called the 3rd ionisation energy. Again, \nusing calcium as an example:\n3rd ionisation energy: Ca2+(g)  \n  Ca3+(g)  +  e–\nΔHi3 = 4940 kJ mol–1\nWe can continue to remove electrons from an atom until \nonly the nucleus is left. We call this sequence of ionisation \nenergies, successive ionisation energies.\nThe successive ionisation energies for the first 11 \nelements in the Periodic Table are shown in Table 3.2.\nThe data in Table 3.2 shows us that:\n■\n■\nFor each element, the successive ionisation energies \nincrease. This is because the charge on the ion gets \ngreater as each electron is removed. As each electron is \nremoved there is a greater attractive force between the \npositively charged protons in the nucleus and the remaining \nnegatively charged electrons. Therefore more energy is \nneeded to overcome these attractive forces.\n■\n■\nThere is a big difference between some successive \nionisation energies. For nitrogen this occurs between \nthe 5th and 6th ionisation energies. For sodium the first \nbig difference occurs between the 1st and 2nd ionisation \nenergies. These large changes indicate that for the second \nof these two ionisation energies the electron being removed \nis from a principal quantum shell closer to the nucleus.\nFor example, for the 5th ionisation energy of nitrogen,  \nthe electron being removed is from the 2nd principal \nquantum shell. For the 6th ionisation energy of nitrogen, \nthe electron being removed is from the 1st principal \nquantum shell.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n1\nH\n1 310\n2\nHe\n2 370\n5 250\n3\nLi\n 519\n7 300\n11 800\n4\nBe\n 900\n1 760\n14 850\n21 000\n5\nB\n 799\n2 420\n 3 660\n25 000\n32 800\n6\nC\n 1 090\n2 350\n 4 620\n 6 220\n37 800\n47 300\n7\nN\n 1 400\n2 860\n 4 580\n 7 480\n 9 450\n53 300\n64 400\n8\nO\n 1 310\n3 390\n 5 320\n 7 450\n11 000\n13 300\n71 300\n84 100\n9\nF\n 1 680\n3 370\n 6 040\n 8 410\n11 000\n15 200\n17 900\n92 000\n106 000\n10\nNe\n 2 080\n3 950\n 6 150\n 9 290\n12 200\n15 200\n20 000\n23 000\n117 000\n131 400\nTable 3.2  Successive ionisation energies for the first 11 elements in the Periodic Table.\n2\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write equations that describe:\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007the 1st ionisation energy of calcium\n\u0007ii\t \u0007the 3rd ionisation energy of potassium\n\u0007iii\t \u0007the 2nd ionisation energy of lithium\n\u0007iv\t \u0007the 5th ionisation energy of sulfur.\n\u0007b\t \u0007The 2nd ionisation energy of nitrogen is \n2860 kJ mol–1.

The bigger the positive \ncharge, the greater the attractive force between the nucleus \nand the electrons. So, more energy is needed to overcome \nthese attractive forces if an electron is to be removed.\n■\n■\nIn general, ionisation energy increases as the proton \nnumber increases.\n\nChapter 3: Electrons in atoms\nElectrons removed\nElement\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n11\nNa\n  494\n4 560\n 6 940\n 9 540\n13 400\n16 600\n20 100\n25 500\n 28 900\n141 000\n158 700\n2  Distance of outer electrons from the \nnucleus\nThe force of attraction between positive and negative \ncharges decreases rapidly as the distance between them \nincreases. So, electrons in shells further away from the \nnucleus are less attracted to the nucleus than those closer \nto the nucleus.\nQuestion\n35\n■\n■\nThe further the outer electron shell is from the nucleus, the \nlower the ionisation energy.\n3  Shielding effect of inner electrons\nAs all electrons are negatively charged, they repel each \nother. Electrons in full inner shells repel electrons in outer \nshells. Full inner shells of electrons prevent the full nuclear \ncharge being felt by the outer electrons. This is called \nshielding. The greater the shielding of outer electrons by \nthe inner electron shells, the lower the attractive forces \nbetween the nucleus and the outer electrons.\n■\n■\nThe ionisation energy is lower as the number of full  \nelectron shells between the outer electrons and the  \nnucleus increases.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nInterpreting successive ionisation \nenergies\nFigure 3.4 shows a graph of successive ionisation  \nenergies against the number of electrons removed for \nsodium.

It is very easily \nremoved from the atom. It is therefore likely to be a long way \nfrom the nucleus and well shielded by inner electron shells.\n■\n■\nThe second electron is much more difficult to remove than \nthe first electron. There is a big jump in the value of the \nionisation energy. This suggests that the second electron is \nin a shell closer to the nucleus than the first electron. Taken \ntogether, the 1st and 2nd ionisation energies suggest that \nsodium has one electron in its outer shell.\n■\n■\nFrom the second to the ninth electrons removed there is \nonly a gradual change in successive ionisation energies. This \nsuggests that all these eight electrons are in the same shell.\n■\n■\nThe 10th and 11th electrons have extremely high ionisation \nenergies, when compared with the rest of the data. This \nsuggests that they are very close to the nucleus. There must \nbe a very great force of attraction between the nucleus and \nthese electrons and there are no inner electrons to shield \nthem. The large increase in ionisation energy between the \n9th and 10th electrons confirms that the 10th electron is in a \nshell closer to the nucleus than the 9th electron.\nFigure 3.5 shows this arrangement of electrons.\n\n1 electron;\nvery easily\nremoved\n2 electrons;\nvery difficult\nto remove\n8 electrons;\nless easily\nremoved\n11+\nnucleus\nFigure 3.5  The arrangement of electrons in an atom of \nsodium can be deduced from the values of successive \nionisation energies.\nQuestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007The successive ionisation energies of boron are \nshown in Table 3.3.\nIonisation\n1st \n2nd \n3rd \n4th \n5th\nIonisation energy / \nkJ mol–1\n799\n2 420 3 660 25 000 32 800\nTable 3.3  Successive ionisation energies of boron.\ni\t\n\u0007Why is there a large increase between the third \nand fourth ionisation energies?\n\u0007ii\t \u0007Explain how these figures confirm that the \nelectronic structure of boron is 2, 3.\n\u0007b\t \u0007For the element aluminium (Z = 13), draw a \nsketch graph to predict the log10 of the successive \nionisation energies (y-axis) against the number of \nelectrons removed (x-axis).\nWe can use successive ionisation energies in this way to:\n■\n■\npredict or confirm the simple electronic configuration  \nof elements\n■\n■\nconfirm the number of electrons in the outer shell of an \nelement and hence the group to which the element belongs.\nworked example\n1\t The successive ionisation energies, ΔHi, of an element\nX are shown in Table 3.4.

In any principal quantum shell, the energy of the \nelectrons in the subshells increases in the order s < p < d.\nThe maximum number of electrons that are allowed  \nin each subshell is: s = 2 electrons, p = 6 electrons,  \nd = 10 electrons.\n■\n■\nThe first principal quantum level, n = 1, can hold a maximum \nof 2 electrons in an s subshell.\n■\n■\nThe second principal quantum level, n = 2, can hold a \nmaximum of 8 electrons: 2 electrons in the s subshell and  \n6 electrons in the p subshell.\n■\n■\nThe third principal quantum level, n = 3, can hold a maximum \nof 18 electrons: 2 electrons in the s subshell, 6 electrons in the  \np subshell and 10 electrons in the d subshell.\nYou will also notice from Figure 3.6 that the order of  \nthe subshells in terms of increasing energy does not  \nfollow a regular pattern of s then p then d after the \nelement argon. The order of subshells after argon appears \nto overlap. The next element after argon is potassium. \nPotassium’s outer electron is in the 4s, not in the 3d, \nsubshell. The first element with an electron in the 3d \nsubshell is element 21, scandium.\nWhen high-speed electrons hit gas particles at low \npressure, coloured lines are seen through an instrument \ncalled a spectroscope. The letters s, p and d come from \nthe terms used to describe these lines: s for ‘sharp’, p for \n‘principal’ and ‘d for ‘diffuse’.\n37\nAtomic orbitals\nEach subshell contains one or more atomic orbitals.\nAn atomic orbital is a region of space around the nucleus \nof an atom that can be occupied by one or two electrons.\nAs each orbital can only hold a maximum of two electrons, \nthe number of orbitals in each subshell must be:\ns – one orbital\np – three orbitals\nd – five orbitals.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nShapes of the orbitals\nEach orbital has a three-dimensional shape.

The 2s orbital in the \nsecond principal quantum shell has the same shape as \nthe 1s orbital in the first quantum shell. They are both \nspherical, but electrons in the 2s orbital have more energy \nthan electrons in the 1s orbital. There are three 2p orbitals \nin the second quantum shell. Each of these has the same \nshape. The shape is like an hourglass with two ‘lobes’. The \nthree sets of ‘lobes’ are arranged at right angles to each \nother along the x, y and z axes. Hence the three 2p orbitals \nare named 2px, 2py and 2pz. The three 2p orbitals have the \nsame energy as each other. There are also three 3p orbitals \nin the third quantum shell. Their shapes are similar to the \nshapes of the 2p orbitals.\nThe d orbitals are more complex in shape and \narrangement in space. In 1925 Louis de Broglie  \nsuggested that electrons behaved like waves. This led \nto the idea of electron probability clouds. The electron \nprobability cloud for one type of d orbital is very strange – \nit is like a modified p orbital with a ring around the middle \n(Figure 3.8). You will not need to know the d-orbital \nshapes at AS level, but you will for A level when studying \nthe transition elements (see Chapter 24).\n\nFigure 3.8  The shape of a dz2 orbital.\nFilling the shells and orbitals\nThe most stable electronic configuration (electronic \nstructure) of an atom is the one that has the lowest amount \nof energy. The order in which the subshells are filled \ndepends on their relative energy. The subshell with the \nlowest energy, the 1s, is therefore filled first, followed by \nthose that are successively higher in energy. As we noted in \nFigure 3.6, the order of the subshells in terms of increasing \nenergy does not follow a regular pattern of s then p then d \nafter argon, where the 3p subshell is full.

So wherever possible, \nelectrons will occupy separate orbitals in the same subshell \nto minimise this repulsion. These electrons have their \n‘spin’ in the same direction. Electrons are only paired \nwhen there are no more empty orbitals available within \na subshell. The spins are then opposite to minimise \nrepulsion.

The sodium ion, Na+ (proton number = 11), has \n10 electrons. So, its electronic configuration is 1s2 2s2 2p6. \nNote that this is the same as the electronic configuration \nof neon, the element with 10 electrons in each atom.\nNegative ions are formed when atoms gain electrons. \nThe sulfide ion, S2– (proton number = 16), has 18 electrons. \nIts electronic configuration is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6, which is \nthe same as argon, the element with 18 electrons in each \natom.\nNote that, in general, electrons in the outer subshell \nare removed when metal ions form their positive ions. \nHowever, the d-block elements behave slightly differently. \nReading across the Periodic Table from potassium to zinc, \nthe 4s subshell fills before the 3d subshell. But when atoms \nof a d-block element lose electrons to form ions, the 4s \nelectrons are lost first. \nFor example:\nTi atom: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2 4s2\nTi2+ ion: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2\nCr atom: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s1\nCr3+ ion: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d3\nQuestion\n9\t \u0007Write electronic configurations for the following ions:\n\u0007a\t \u0007Al3+ (Z = 13)\t\nd\t\n\u0007Cu2+ (Z = 29)\n\u0007b\t \u0007O2– (Z = 8)\t\ne\t\n\u0007Cu+ (Z = 29)\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Fe3+ (Z = 26)\n\nChapter 3: Electrons in atoms\nPatterns in ionisation energies \nin the Periodic Table\nPatterns across a period\nFigure 3.13 shows how the first ionisation energy, ΔHi1, \nchanges across the first two periods. We can explain the \nform of the graph mainly by referring to the factors that \ninfluence ionisation energies (see page 35).\nNe\nHe\n2500\nFirst ionisation energy /kJ mol–1\n2000\nN\nF\n1500\nBe\nC\nO\nH\n1000\nB\n500\nLi\nNa\n0\n0\n5\nAtomic number (Z)\n10\nFigure 3.13  A graph of the first ionisation energies of the \nelements hydrogen to sodium plotted against atomic number.\n41\n1\t There is a general increase in ΔHi1 across a period. This \napplies to Period 1 (hydrogen and helium), Period 2 \n(lithium to neon) and also to other periods. As you go \nacross a period the nuclear charge increases. But the \nelectron removed comes from the same shell. So, the \nforce of attraction between the positive nucleus and the \nouter negative electrons increases across the  \nperiod because:\n\t\ni\t\nthe nuclear charge increases\n\t\nii\t \u0007the distance between the nucleus and the outer \nelectron remains reasonably constant\n\t\niii\t \u0007the shielding by inner shells remains  \nreasonably constant.\n2\t There is a rapid decrease in ionisation energy between \nthe last element in one period and the first element in \nthe next period. The ΔHi1 for lithium is much smaller \nthan the ΔHi1 for helium. Helium has two electrons. \nThese are in the first quantum shell. But lithium has \nthree electrons. The third electron must go into the \nnext quantum shell further away from the nucleus. So, \nthe force of attraction between the positive nucleus and \nthe outer negative electrons decreases because:\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\ni\t\nthe distance between the nucleus and the outer \nelectron increases\nii\t the shielding by inner shells increases\niii\t these two factors outweigh the increased nuclear charge.\n3\t There is a slight decrease in ΔHi1 between beryllium \nand boron. Although boron has one more proton than \nberyllium, there is a slight decrease in ΔHi1 on removal \nof the outer electron. Beryllium has the electronic \nstructure 1s2 2s2 and boron has the electronic  \nstructure 1s2 2s2 2p1. The fifth electron in boron must \nbe in the 2p subshell, which is slightly further away \nfrom the nucleus than the 2s subshell. There is less \nattraction between the fifth electron in boron and the \nnucleus because:\ni\t\nthe distance between the nucleus and the outer \nelectron increases slightly\nii\t the shielding by inner shells increases slightly\niii\t these two factors outweigh the increased  \nnuclear charge.\n4\t There is a slight decrease in ΔHi1 between nitrogen  \nand oxygen. Oxygen has one more proton than \nnitrogen and the electron removed is in the same 2p \nsubshell. So, you might think that ΔHi1 would  \nincrease. However, the spin-pairing of the electrons \nplays a part here. If you look back at Figure 3.12, you \nwill see that the electron removed from the nitrogen  \nis from an orbital that contains an unpaired electron. \nThe electron removed from the oxygen is from the \norbital that contains a pair of electrons. The extra \nrepulsion between the pair of electrons in this orbital \nresults in less energy being needed to remove an \nelectron. So, ΔHi1 for oxygen is lower, because of  \nspin-pair repulsion.\n42\nThese patterns repeat themselves across the third period. \nHowever, the presence of the d-block elements in Period 4  \ndisrupts the pattern, as d-block elements have first \nionisation energies that are relatively similar and fairly high.\n\nPatterns down a group\nThe first ionisation energy decreases as you go down a \ngroup in the Periodic Table. For example, in Group 1 the \nvalues of ΔHi1 are:\n■\n■\nLi = 519 kJ mol–1\n■\n■\nNa = 494 kJ mol–1\n■\n■\nK = 418 kJ mol–1\n■\n■\nRb = 403 kJ mol–1\nAs you go down the group, the outer electron removed \nis from the same type of orbital but from a successively \nhigher principal quantum level – 2s from lithium, 3s \nfor sodium and 4s for potassium. Although the nuclear \ncharge is increasing down the group there is less attraction \nbetween the outer electron and the nucleus because:\n1\t the distance between the nucleus and the outer  \nelectron increases\n2\t the shielding by complete inner shells increases\n3\t these two factors outweigh the increased nuclear charge.\nQuestion\n10\t \u0007a\t \u0007The first ionisation energies of four consecutive \nelements in the Periodic Table are:\nsodium = 494 kJ mol–1\nmagnesium = 736 kJ mol–1\naluminium = 577 kJ mol–1\nsilicon = 786 kJ mol–1\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007Explain the general increase in ionisation \nenergies from sodium to silicon.\n\u0007ii\t \u0007Explain why aluminium has a lower first \nionisation energy than magnesium.\n\u0007b\t \u0007The first ionisation energy of fluorine is \n1680 kJ mol–1 whereas the first ionisation energy of \niodine is 1010 kJ mol–1.

Understanding what bonding is,  \nand how bonds can be formed or broken, gives us the \nability to extract resources from the Earth and make \nnew compounds.\nFigure 4.1  This sodium chloride (salt) has been extracted \nfrom the ground. Sodium chloride is an ionic compound.\nTypes of chemical bonding\nIonic bonding is the electrostatic attraction between positive \nand negative ions in an ionic crystal lattice. Covalent bonds \nare formed when the outer electrons of two atoms are shared. \nThe ionic or covalent bonds formed are usually very strong \n– it takes a lot of energy to break them. There is also a third \nform of strong bonding: metallic bonding.\nAlthough the atoms within molecules are kept  \ntogether by strong covalent bonds, the forces between \nmolecules are weak. We call these weak forces \nintermolecular forces.\nThere are several types of intermolecular force:\n■\n■\nvan der Waals’ forces (also called ‘dispersion forces’ and \n‘temporary dipole–induced dipole forces’)\n■\n■\npermanent dipole–dipole forces\n■\n■\nhydrogen bonds.\nAn understanding of these different types of chemical \nbonding and an understanding of intermolecular forces \nhelps us to explain the structure and physical properties  \nof elements and compounds.\nIonic bonding\nHow are ions formed?\nOne way of forming ions is for atoms to gain or lose one or \nmore electrons.\n■\n■\nPositive ions are formed when an atom loses one or more \nelectrons. Metal atoms usually lose electrons and form \npositive ions.\n■\n■\nNegative ions are formed when an atom gains one or  \nmore electrons. Non-metal atoms usually gain electrons \nand form negative ions.\n\nChapter 4: Chemical bonding\nThe charge on the ion depends on the number of electrons \nlost or gained (see page 41).\nWhen metals combine with non-metals, the electrons \nin the outer shell of the metal atoms are transferred to \nthe non-metal atoms. Each non-metal atom usually gains \nenough electrons to fill its outer shell. As a result of this, \nthe metal and non-metal atoms usually end up with outer \nelectron shells that are complete – they have an electronic \nconfiguration of a noble gas.\nIn Figure 4.2 we can see that:\n49\n■\n■\nthe sodium ion has the electronic structure [2,8]+, the same \nas that of neon\n■\n■\nthe chloride ion has the electronic structure [2,8,8]–, the \nsame as that of argon.\nNa\nCl\n2,8,1\n2,8,7\n+\n–\nCl\nNa\n[2,8]+\n[2,8,8]–\nNaCl (Na+ Cl–)\nFigure 4.2  The formation of a sodium ion and chloride ion \nby electron transfer.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nFigure 4.3  These crystals of salt are made up of millions of \nsodium ions and chloride ions.\nThe strong force of attraction between the positive and \nnegative ions in the ionic crystal lattice results in an ionic \nbond. An ionic bond is sometimes called an electrovalent \nbond. In an ionic structure, the ions are arranged in a \nregular repeating pattern (see Chapter 5). As a result of \nthis, the force between one ion and the ions of opposite \ncharge that surround it is very great. In other words, ionic \nbonding is very strong.\n50\nDot-and-cross diagrams\nYou will notice that in Figure 4.2 we used dots and crosses to \nshow the electronic configuration of the chloride and sodium \nions. This helps us keep track of where the electrons have come \nfrom. It does not mean that the electron transferred is any \ndifferent from the others. Diagrams like this are called  \ndot-and-cross diagrams.\nWhen drawing a dot-and-cross diagram for an ionic \ncompound it is usually acceptable to draw the outer \nelectron shell of the metal ion without any electrons. This \nis because it has transferred these electrons to the negative \nion. Figure 4.4 shows the outer shell dot-and-cross \ndiagram for sodium chloride.\nA dot-and-cross diagram shows:\n■\n■\nthe outer electron shells only\n■\n■\nthat the charge of the ion is spread evenly, by using  \nsquare brackets\n■\n■\nthe charge on each ion, written at the top right-hand corner \nof the square brackets.\n\n+\n–\nNa\nCl\nFigure 4.4  Dot-and-cross diagram for sodium chloride.\nSome examples of dot-and-cross \ndiagrams\nMagnesium oxide\nWhen magnesium reacts with oxygen to form magnesium \noxide, the two electrons in the outer shell of each magnesium \natom are transferred to the incompletely filled orbitals of \nan oxygen atom. By losing two electrons, each magnesium \natom achieves the electronic configuration [2,8] (Figure \n4.5). By gaining two electrons, each oxygen atom achieves \nthe electronic configuration [2,8].

The  \ngreater force of attraction between the electrons and the \nnuclei pulls the atoms closer together. This results in a \nstronger bond. We measure the strength of a bond by  \nits bond energy. This is the energy needed to break one \nmole of a given bond in a gaseous molecule (see also \nChapter 6).

It takes a lot of energy to break the nitrogen \natoms apart; the bond energy required is 994 kJ mol–1. \nOxygen is much more reactive. Although it has a double \nbond, it only takes 496 kJ to break a mole of O   O bonds. \nHowever, bond strength is only one factor that influences \nthe reactivity of a molecule. The polarity of the bond (see \npage 61) and whether the bond is a σ bond (sigma bond) or \na π bond (pi bond) (see page 57) both play a large part in \ndetermining chemical reactivity.\nCl\nCl\nCl\nCl\nCl\nCl\nCl\nCl\nCl\nCl\nAl\nAl\nCl\nCl\nCl\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nQuestion\n5\t \u0007The table lists bond lengths and bond energies of \nsome hydrogen halides.\nHydrogen \nhalide\nBond \nlength / nm\nBond \nenergy / kJ mol–1\nHCl\n0.127\n431\nHBr\n0.141\n366\nHI\n0.161\n299\n\u0007a\t \u0007What is the relationship between the bond length \nand the bond energy for these hydrogen halides?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Suggest why the bond energy values decrease in \nthe order HCl > HBr > HI.\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Suggest a value for the bond length in hydrogen \nfluoride, HF.\nShapes of molecules\nElectron-pair repulsion theory\nBecause all electrons have the same (negative) charge, they \nrepel each other when they are close together. So, a pair \nof electrons in the bonds surrounding the central atom in \na molecule will repel other electron pairs. This repulsion \nforces the pairs of electrons apart until the repulsive forces \nare minimised.\nThe shape and bond angles of a covalently bonded \nmolecule depend on:\n■\n■\nthe number of pairs of electrons around each atom\n■\n■\nwhether these pairs are lone pairs or bonding pairs.\nLone pairs of electrons have a more concentrated electron \ncharge cloud than bonding pairs of electrons. Their  \ncloud charges are wider and slightly closer to the nucleus \nof the central atom. This results in a different amount  \nof repulsion between different types of electron pairs.  \nThe order of repulsion is lone pair–lone pair (most \nrepulsion) > lone pair–bond pair > bond pair–bond pair \n(least repulsion).\nFigure 4.15 shows the repulsions between lone pairs \n(pink) and bonding pairs (white) in a water molecule.\ngreatest repulsion between lone pairs\nO\nintermediate repulsion\nH\nO\nH angle is 104.5°\nH\nH\nleast repulsion between bonding pairs\nFigure 4.15  Repulsion between lone and bonding electron \npairs in water.\n\nChapter 4: Chemical bonding\nWorking out the shapes of molecules\nThe differences in electron-pair repulsion determine the \nshape and bond angles in a molecule.

Each atom that combines has an atomic \norbital containing a single unpaired electron. In the \nformation of a covalent bond the atomic orbitals overlap \nso that a combined orbital is formed, containing two \nelectrons. We call this combined orbital a molecular \norbital. The amount of overlap of the atomic orbitals \ndetermines the strength of the bond: the greater the \noverlap, the stronger the bond.

Figure 4.24 shows how a π bond is formed from two \np orbitals overlapping sideways.\nWe often draw a single π bond as two electron clouds, \none arising from each lobe of the p orbitals.

We would expect the H   C   H bond \nangle in ethene to be about 120° because the three areas \nof electron density of the σ bonds are equally distributed. \nHowever, because of the position of the π bond, this bond \nangle is actually 117°. This minimises the repulsive forces.\nMetallic bonding\nWhat is a metallic bond?\nFigure 4.28  Metals, clockwise from top left: sodium, gold, \nmercury, magnesium and copper.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nIn a metal, the atoms are packed closely together in a \nregular arrangement called a lattice. Metal atoms in a \nlattice tend to lose their outer shell electrons and become \npositive ions. The outer shell electrons occupy new energy \nlevels and are free to move throughout the metal lattice. \nWe call these electrons delocalised electrons (mobile \nelectrons). Delocalised electrons are electrons that are not \nassociated with any one particular atom or bond.\nMetallic bonding is strong. This is because the ions \nare held together by the strong electrostatic attraction \nbetween their positive charges and the negative charges of \nthe delocalised electrons (Figure 4.29). This electrostatic \nattraction acts in all directions. The strength of metallic \nbonding increases with:\n■\n■\nincreasing positive charge on the ions in the metal lattice\n■\n■\ndecreasing size of metal ions in the lattice\n■\n■\nincreasing number of mobile electrons per atom.\nMetallic bonding and the properties of \nmetals\nWe can use our model of metallic bonding to explain \nmany of the properties of metals.\nMost metals have high melting points and \nhigh boiling points\nIt takes a lot of energy to weaken the strong attractive \nforces between the metal ions and the delocalised \nelectrons. These attractive forces can only be overcome \nat high temperatures. However, mercury is a liquid at \nroom temperature (Figure 4.30). This is because some of \nthe electrons in a mercury atom are bound more tightly \nthan usual to the nucleus, weakening the metallic bonds \nbetween atoms.\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nFigure 4.29  Metallic bonding: there are strong attractive forces between the positively charged ions and the \ndelocalised electrons.\n\nChapter 4: Chemical bonding\nFigure 4.30  Mercury is a liquid at room temperature.\nMetals conduct electricity\nWhen a voltage is applied to a piece of metal, an electric \ncurrent flows in it because the delocalised electrons \n(mobile electrons) are free to move. Metallic bonding is \nthe only type of bonding that allows us to predict reliably \nthat a solid will conduct electricity. Covalent solids cannot \nconduct electricity because none of their electrons are free \nto move, although graphite is an exception to this.

However, the forces between molecules are much \nweaker. We call these forces intermolecular forces.\nThere are three types of intermolecular force:\n60\n■\n■\nvan der Waals’ forces (which are also called dispersion \nforces and temporary dipole–induced dipole forces)\n■\n■\npermanent dipole–dipole forces\n■\n■\nhydrogen bonding.\nTable 4.2 compares the relative strength of these \nintermolecular forces and other bonds.\nType of bond\nBond strength  \n/ kJ mol–1\nionic bonding in sodium chloride\n760\nO   H covalent bond in water \n464\nhydrogen bonding\n20–50\npermanent dipole–dipole force\n5–20\nvan der Waals’ forces\n1–20\nTable 4.2  Strengths of different types of bond and \nintermolecular force.\nIn order to understand how intermolecular forces  \nwork, we first have to know about electronegativity and \nbond polarity.\n\nFigure 4.31  The intermolecular forces in water allow some \ninsects to skate over its surface.\nElectronegativity\nElectronegativity is the ability of a particular atom, which \nis covalently bonded to another atom, to attract the bond \npair of electrons towards itself.\nThe greater the value of the electronegativity, the greater \nthe power of an atom to attract the electrons in a covalent \nbond towards itself. For Groups 1 to 17 the pattern of \nelectronegativity is:\n■\n■\nelectronegativity increases across a period from Group 1 to \nGroup 17\n■\n■\nelectronegativity increases up each group.\nThis means that fluorine is the most electronegative \nelement.\nFor the most electronegative elements, the order of \nelectronegativity is:\nincreasing electronegativity\nBr < Cl < N < O < F\nCarbon and hydrogen have electronegativities that are \nlower than those of most other non-metallic elements.\nPolarity in molecules\nWhen the electronegativity values of the two atoms \nforming a covalent bond are the same, the pair of electrons \nis equally shared. We say that the covalent bond is  \nnon-polar. For example, hydrogen (H2), chlorine (Cl2) and \nbromine (Br2) are non-polar molecules.\nWhen a covalent bond is formed between two atoms \nhaving different electronegativity values, the more \nelectronegative atom attracts the pair of electrons in the \nbond towards it.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nAs a result:\n■\n■\nthe centre of positive charge does not coincide with the \ncentre of negative charge\n■\n■\nwe say that the electron distribution is asymmetric\n■\n■\nthe two atoms are partially charged\n■\n■\nwe show\n–\t\nthe less electronegative atom with the partial charge δ+ \n(‘delta positive’)\n–\t\nthe more electronegative atom with the partial charge \nδ– (‘delta negative’)\n■\n■\nwe say that the bond is polar (or that it has a dipole).\nFigure 4.32 shows the polar bond in a hydrogen  \nchloride molecule.\nCl\nH\nδ+\nδ–\nFigure 4.32  Hydrogen chloride is a polar molecule.\nAs the difference in electronegativity values of the atoms \nin a covalent bond increases, the bond becomes more \npolar. The degree of polarity of a molecule is measured as a \ndipole moment. The direction of the dipole is shown by the \nsign \n. The arrow points to the partially negatively \ncharged end of the dipole.\nIn molecules containing more than two atoms, we have \nto take into account:\n■\n■\nthe polarity of each bond\n■\n■\nthe arrangement of the bonds in the molecule.\nTrichloromethane, CHCl3, is a polar molecule. The \nthree C   Cl dipoles point in a similar direction. Their \ncombined effect is not cancelled out by the polarity of the \nC   H bond. This is because the C   H bond is virtually \nnon-polar. The electron distribution is asymmetric. The \nmolecule is polar, with the negative end towards the \nchlorine atoms. This is shown in Figure 4.33a.\nH\na\nb\nδ+\nCl\nC\nC\nCl\nCl\nδ–\nCl\nCl\nCl\nCl\ntrichloromethane, \na polar molecule\ntetrachloromethane, \na non-polar molecule\nFigure 4.33  The polarity of a  trichloromethane and \nb  tetrachloromethane.\nSome molecules contain polar bonds but have no overall \npolarity. This is because the polar bonds in these molecules \nare arranged in such a fashion that the dipole moments\n\nChapter 4: Chemical bonding\ncancel each other out. An example is tetrachloromethane, \nCCl4 (Figure 4.33b). Tetrachloromethane has four polar \nC   Cl bonds pointing towards the four corners of a \ntetrahedron. The dipoles in each bond cancel each other. \nSo, tetrachloromethane is non-polar.\nThe charge distribution in molecules and ions can be \ndetermined by a method called X-ray spectroscopy. One \nmethod involves firing X-rays at molecules and measuring \nthe energy of the electrons given off. Using this method, \nscientists have found that in a sulfate ion, the sulfur atom \nhas a charge of +1.12 units and the four oxygen atoms each \nhave a charge of –0.78 units.\nQuestion\n9\t \u0007Are the following molecules polar or non-polar?

For example, \nboth nitrogen, N   N, and carbon monoxide, C   O, have \ntriple bonds requiring a similar amount of energy to \nbreak them. Nitrogen is a non-polar molecule and is fairly \nunreactive. But carbon monoxide is a polar molecule, and \nthis explains its reactivity with oxygen and its use as a \nreducing agent. Many chemical reactions are started by a \nreagent attacking one of the electrically charged ends of a \npolar molecule. For example, chloroethane, C2H5Cl, is far \nmore reactive than ethane, C2H6. This is because reagents \nsuch as OH– ions can attack the delta-positive carbon atom \nof the polarised C   Cl bond (see also page 220).\nH\nH\nC\nH\nCl\nδ+\nδ–\nC\nH\nH\nSuch an attack is not possible with ethane because the  \nC   H bond is virtually non-polar. This helps to explain \nwhy alkanes, such as ethane, are not very reactive.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nvan der Waals’ forces\nNoble gases such as neon and argon exist as isolated atoms. \nNoble gases can be liquefied, but at very low temperatures, \nso there must be very weak forces of attraction between \ntheir atoms. These weak forces keep the atoms together in \nthe liquid state.\nBromine is a non-polar molecule that is liquid at  \nroom temperature. The weak forces of attraction are \nkeeping the bromine molecules together at room \ntemperature. These very weak forces of attraction are \ncalled van der Waals’ forces. van der Waals’ forces exist \nbetween all atoms or molecules. So, how do van der \nWaals’ forces arise?\nThe electron charge clouds in a non-polar molecule \n(or atom) are constantly moving. It often happens that \nmore of the charge cloud is on one side of the molecule \nthan the other. This means that one end of the molecule \nhas, for a short moment, more negative charge than the \nother. A temporary dipole is set up. This dipole can set up \n(induce) a dipole on neighbouring molecules. As a result \nof this, there are forces of attraction between the δ+ end \nof the dipole in one molecule and the δ– end of the dipole \nin a neighbouring molecule (Figure 4.34). These dipoles \nare always temporary because the electrons clouds are \nalways moving. van der Waals’ forces are sometimes called \ntemporary dipole–induced dipole forces.\nvan der Waals’ forces increase with\n62\n■\n■\nincreasing number of electrons (and protons) in the molecule\n■\n■\nincreasing the number of contact points between the \nmolecules – contact points are places where the molecules \ncome close together.\nDifferences in the size of the van der Waals’ forces can \nbe used to explain the trend in the enthalpy change of \nvaporisation and boiling points of the noble gases. Figure \n4.35 shows how these vary with the number of electrons \npresent. (The enthalpy change of vaporisation is the energy \nrequired to convert a mole of liquid into a mole of gas.)\n20\na\nb\n–100\nEnthalpy of vaporisation /kJ mol–1\nXe\nBoiling point /°C\nAr\nKr\n10\n–200\nAr\nNe\nHe\nNe\nHe\n0\n–270\n40\n0\n20\n60\nNumber of electrons\nNumber of electrons\n\nδ–\nδ+\natom without\ndipole\nelectron movements\nresult in temporary\ndipole\nδ+\nδ+\nδ–\nas atoms \napproach each\nother, the dipole\non one atom\ninduces a dipole\non another\nδ–\nrepulsion\nδ–\nδ+\nδ+\nδ–\nattraction\nFigure 4.34  How van der Waals’ forces arise.\nYou can see that both the enthalpy change of vaporisation \nand the boiling points of the noble gases increase as the \nnumber of electrons increases. This is because the van  \nder Waals’ forces between the atoms are increased with  \nan increasing number of electrons. So, more energy is \nneeded to change the liquid into vapour and the boiling \npoint is higher.\nThe effect of increasing the number of contact points \ncan be seen by comparing the boiling points of pentane \n(boiling point 36 °C) and 2,2-dimethylpropane (boiling \npoint 10 °C) (Figure 4.36). These compounds have equal \nnumbers of electrons in their molecules.\nThe molecules in pentane can line up beside each other \nso there are a large number of contact points. The van der \nWaals’ forces are higher, so the boiling point is higher. \nThe molecules of 2,2-dimethylpropane are more compact. \nThe surface area available for coming into contact with \nneighbouring molecules is smaller. The van der Waals’ \nforces are relatively lower, so the boiling point is lower.\nThe van der Waals’ forces between individual atoms are very \nsmall. However, the total van der Waals’ forces between very \nlong non-polar molecules such as poly(ethene) molecules (see \npage 211) can be much larger. That is why poly(ethene) is a \nsolid at room temperature.\nXe\nKr\nFigure 4.35  a  Enthalpy changes of \nvaporisation and b  boiling points of the \nnoble gases plotted against the number \nof electrons present.\n40\n0\n20\n60\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCH3\nCH2\nCH3\nCH2\nCH2\nCH3\nCH2\nCH3\nCH2\nCH2\nCH3\npentane,\nboiling point 36 °C\nTwo types of poly(ethene) are low-density poly(ethene), \nLDPE, and high-density poly(ethene), HDPE.

Molecules \nwith a permanent dipole are called polar molecules. A \nfine jet of polar molecules will be attracted towards an \nelectrically charged plastic rod or comb. (The rod can be \ncharged by rubbing it with a woollen cloth.) Figure 4.38 \nshows the result of this experiment.\nThe molecules are always attracted to the charged \nrod, whether it is positively or negatively charged. This is \nbecause the molecules have both negatively and positively \ncharged ends.\nThe forces between two molecules having permanent \ndipoles are called permanent dipole–dipole forces.  \nThe attractive force between the δ+ charge on one \nmolecule and the δ– charge on a neighbouring  \nmolecule causes a weak attractive force between the \nmolecules (Figure 4.39).\n63\nFigure 4.38  The deflection of water by an electrically \ncharged nylon comb.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nweak permanent\ndipole–dipole force\nCH3\nCH3\nδ–\nδ+\nC\nO\nδ–\nδ+\nC\nO\nCH3\nCH3\nFigure 4.39  Dipole–dipole forces in propanone.\nFor small molecules with the same number of electrons, \npermanent dipole–dipole forces are often stronger \nthan van der Waals’ forces.

There are only van der Waals’ forces \nbetween butane molecules. These forces are comparatively \nweak, so butane is a gas at room temperature.\nQuestion\n11\t \u0007Bromine, Br2, and iodine monochloride, ICl, have the \nsame number of electrons. But the boiling point of \niodine monochloride is nearly 40 °C higher than the \nboiling point of bromine. Explain this difference.\nHydrogen bonding\nHydrogen bonding is the strongest type of intermolecular \nforce. For hydrogen bonding to occur between two \nmolecules we need:\n■\n■\none molecule having a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to \nF, O or N (the three most electronegative atoms)\n■\n■\na second molecule having a F, O or N atom with an available \nlone pair of electrons.\n\nWhen a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to a very \nelectronegative atom, the bond is very highly polarised. \nThe δ+ charge on the hydrogen atom is high enough for \na bond to be formed with a lone pair of electrons on the \nF, O or N atom of a neighbouring molecule (Figure 4.41). \nThe force of attraction is about one-tenth of the strength \nof a normal covalent bond. For maximum bond strength, \nthe angle between the covalent bond to the hydrogen atom \nand the hydrogen bond is usually 180°.\nH\nH\nH\nH\nN\nN\nH\nH\nFigure 4.41  Hydrogen bonding between two ammonia \nmolecules.

This leads to increased van der Waals’ \nforces as the molecules get bigger. If hydrogen fluoride \nonly had van der Waals’ forces between its molecules, \nwe would expect its boiling point to be about –90 °C. \nHowever, the boiling point of hydrogen fluoride is 20 °C, \nwhich is much higher.

Figure \n4.44 shows the enthalpy changes of vaporisation of water \nand other Group 16 hydrides.\nThe rise in enthalpy change of vaporisation from H2S \nto H2Te is due to the increasing number of electrons in \nthe Group 16 atoms as we go down the group. This leads \nto increased van der Waals’ forces as the molecules get \nbigger. If water only had van der Waals’ forces between \nits molecules, we would expect its enthalpy change to be \nabout 17 kJ mol–1. But the enthalpy change of vaporisation \nof water is much higher. This is because water is \nextensively hydrogen bonded. The boiling point of water \nis also much higher than predicted by the trend in boiling \npoints for the other Group 16 hydrides. This also indicates \nthat much more energy is required to break the bonds \nbetween water molecules compared with other hydrides of \nGroup 16 elements.\n65\n50\nH2O\n40\nEnthalpy change of \nvaporisation / kJ mol–1\n30\nH2Te\nH2S\nH2Se\n20\n10\n20\n0\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nNumber of electrons\nFigure 4.44  Enthalpy changes of vaporisation for Group 16 \nhydrides plotted against number of electrons present.\n2  Surface tension and viscosity\nWater has a high surface tension and high viscosity.\nHydrogen bonding reduces the ability of water \nmolecules to slide over each other, so the viscosity of \nwater is high.

This is \nbecause the molecules are more closely packed in the \nsolid state. But this is not true of water. In ice, there is a \nthree-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network of water \nmolecules. This produces a rigid lattice in which each \noxygen atom is surrounded by a tetrahedron of hydrogen \natoms. This ‘more open’ arrangement, due to the relatively \nlong hydrogen bonds, allows the water molecules to be \nslightly further apart than in the liquid (Figure 4.46). So \nthe density of ice is less than that of liquid water.\n66\nFigure 4.45  Ice floats on water.\nFigure 4.46  A model of ice.

This is because:\n■\n■\nthere are strong electrostatic forces (ionic bonds) holding \nthe positive and negative ions together\n■\n■\nthe ions are regularly arranged in a lattice (see Chapter 5), \nwith the oppositely charged ions close to each other.\nIonic compounds have high melting points, high boiling \npoints and high enthalpy changes of vaporisation. It \ntakes a lot of energy to overcome the strong electrostatic \nattractive forces.\nMetals\nMetals, apart from mercury, are solids. Most metals have \nhigh melting points, high boiling points and high enthalpy \nchanges of vaporisation. This is because it takes a lot of \nenergy to overcome the strong attractive forces between \nthe positive ions and the ‘sea’ of delocalised electrons.\nCovalent compounds\nCovalently bonded substances with a simple molecular \nstructure, for example water and ammonia, are usually \nliquids or gases. This is because the forces between the \nmolecules are weak. It does not take much energy to \novercome these intermolecular forces, so these substances \nhave low melting points, low boiling points and low \nenthalpy changes of vaporisation compared with ionic \ncompounds. Some substances that have covalently bonded \nmolecules may be solids at room temperature, for example \niodine and poly(ethene). These are usually molecules \nwhere the van der Waals’ forces are considerable. However, \nthe melting points of these substances are still fairly low \ncompared with ionic compounds or most metals.\nSolubility\nIonic compounds\nMost ionic compounds are soluble in water. This is because \nwater molecules are polar and they are attracted to the \nions on the surface of the ionic solid. These attractions \nare called ion–dipole attractions (see page 265). These\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nattractions replace the electrostatic forces between the ions \nand the ions go into solution.\nMetals\nMetals do not dissolve in water. However, some metals, for \nexample sodium and calcium, react with water.\nCovalent compounds\nCovalently bonded substances with a simple molecular \nstructure fall into two groups.\n■\n■\nThose that are insoluble in water. Most covalently bonded \nmolecules are non-polar. Water molecules are not attracted \nto them so they are insoluble. An example is iodine.\n■\n■\nThose that are soluble in water. Small molecules that can \nform hydrogen bonds with water are generally soluble. An \nexample is ethanol, C2H5OH.\nSome covalently bonded substances react with water rather \nthan dissolving in it. For example, hydrogen chloride \nreacts with water to form hydrogen ions and chloride ions, \nand the ions are soluble. Silicon chloride reacts with water \nto form hydrogen ions, chloride ions and silicon dioxide. \nThis reaction is called a hydrolysis reaction.\nElectrical conductivity\nIonic compounds\nIonic compounds do not conduct electricity when in the \nsolid state. This is because the ions are fixed in the lattice \nand can only vibrate around a fixed point. When molten, \nan ionic compound conducts electricity because the ions \nare mobile.\nSummary\n■\t Ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons.\n■\t Ionic (electrovalent) bonding involves an  \nattractive force between positively and negatively \ncharged ions in an ionic lattice.\n■\t A covalent bond is formed when atoms share a pair \nof electrons.\n■\t When atoms form covalent or ionic bonds each atom \nor ion has a full outer electron shell of electrons. \n(Some covalent compounds may be electron \ndeficient or have an ‘expanded octet’.)\n■\t Dot-and-cross diagrams can be drawn to show  \nthe arrangement of electrons in ionic and  \ncovalent compounds.\n\nChapter 4: Chemical bonding\nMetals\nMetals conduct electricity both when solid and when \nmolten.

Gas particles:\n■\n■\nare far apart, therefore gases can be compressed\n■\n■\nare randomly arranged\n■\n■\ncan move freely from place to place, in all directions.\nLiquids take the shape of the container they occupy.  \nLiquid particles:\n■\n■\nare close together, so liquids have a fixed volume and can \nonly be compressed slightly\n■\n■\nare arranged fairly randomly\n■\n■\nhave limited movement from place to place, in all directions.\nSolids have a fixed shape and volume.

In reality, the gases we encounter don’t fit this \ndescription exactly, although they may come very close. \nThe gases we encounter are called real gases.\nNoble gases with small atoms, such as helium and \nneon, approach ideal gas behaviour. This is because the \nintermolecular forces are so small.\nQuestion\n2\t \u0007Explain why the intermolecular forces in a sample of \nhelium and neon are very small.\nIdeal gases\nThe volume that a gas occupies depends on:\n■\n■\nits pressure; we measure pressure in pascals, Pa\n■\n■\nits temperature; we measure temperatures of gases in  \nkelvin, K.\nThe kelvin temperature equals the Celsius temperature \nplus 273.

This is because the gas \nmolecules are constantly hitting the walls of the container. \nIf we decrease the volume of a gas (at constant temperature) \nthe molecules are squashed closer together and hit the \nwalls of the container more often. So the pressure of the gas \nincreases (Figure 5.2a). A graph of volume of gas plotted \nagainst 1/pressure gives a proportional relationship (as \nshown by the straight line in Figure 5.2b). We say that the \nvolume is inversely proportional to the pressure.\nWhen a gas is heated at constant pressure its volume \nincreases (Figure 5.3a). This is because the particles move \nfaster and hit the walls of the container with greater force. If \nthe pressure is to be constant the molecules must get further \napart. The volume of a gas at constant pressure is proportional \nto its temperature measured in kelvin (Figure 5.3b).\nVolume\n0\n0\n1\npressure\nVolume\n0\n0\nTemperature / K\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nAn ideal gas will have a volume that varies exactly in \nproportion to its temperature and exactly in inverse \nproportion to its pressure.\nQuestion\n4\t \u0007Some chemical reactions involving gases are \nperformed in sealed glass tubes that do not melt  \nat high temperatures. The tubes have thin walls  \nand can easily break. Use the kinetic theory of  \ngases to explain why the tubes should not be heated \nto high temperatures.\nLimitations of the ideal gas laws\nScientists have taken accurate measurements to show how \nthe volumes of gases change with temperature and pressure. \nThese show us that gases do not always behave exactly as we \nexpect an ideal gas to behave. This is because real gases do \nnot always obey the kinetic theory in two ways:\n■\n■\nthere is not zero attraction between the molecules\n■\n■\nwe cannot ignore the volume of the molecules themselves.\nThese differences are especially noticeable at very  \nhigh pressures and very low temperatures.

Calculate the relative molecular mass of \nliquid X.\n(R = 8.31 J K–1 mol–1)\nThe liquid state\nThe behaviour of liquids\nWhen we heat a solid:\n■\n■\nthe energy transferred to the solid makes the particles \nvibrate more vigorously\n■\n■\nthe forces of attraction between the particles weaken\n■\n■\nthe solid changes to a liquid when its temperature is \nsufficiently high.\nWe call this change of state melting.\nFor ionic compounds, a high temperature is needed \nbecause ionic bonding is very strong. For molecular \nsolids, a lower temperature is needed, just enough to \novercome the weak intermolecular forces between  \nthe particles.\nThe particles in a liquid are still close to each other but \nthey have enough kinetic energy to keep sliding past each \nother in a fairly random way. They do not move freely as \ngas particles do. For brief periods, the particles in liquids \nare arranged in a slightly ordered way. But this order is \nalways being broken up when the particles gain kinetic \nenergy from neighbouring particles.\n\nChapter 5: States of matter\nWhen we cool a liquid, the particles:\n■\n■\nlose kinetic energy so they do not move around so readily\n■\n■\nexperience increasing forces of attraction\n■\n■\nstop sliding past each other when the temperature is \nsufficiently low; the liquid solidifies.\nWe call this change of state freezing.\nVaporisation and vapour pressure\nWhen we heat a liquid:\n■\n■\nthe energy transferred to the liquid makes the particles \nmove faster\n■\n■\nthe forces of attraction between the particles weaken\n■\n■\nthe particles with most energy are the first to escape from \nthe forces holding them together in the liquid\n■\n■\nthe liquid evaporates – this happens at a temperature below \nthe boiling point\n■\n■\nthe forces weaken enough for all the particles to become \ncompletely free from each other; they move fast and \nrandomly and they spread out\n■\n■\nthe liquid boils; this happens at the boiling point.\nThis change from the liquid state to the gas state is called \nvaporisation. The energy required to change one mole  \nof liquid to one mole of gas is called the enthalpy change  \nof vaporisation.\nWhen we cool a vapour, the particles:\n77\n■\n■\nlose kinetic energy so the molecules move around  \nless quickly\n■\n■\nexperience increasing forces of attraction\n■\n■\nmove more slowly and become closer together when the \ntemperature is sufficiently low; the gas liquefies.\nWe call this change of state condensation.\nThese changes in state are reversible. Water can be \nboiled to form steam, and steam can be condensed to \nform liquid water. These changes involve opposite energy \ntransfers. For example: energy has to be transferred to \nwater to boil it to form steam. But when steam condenses \nto form water, energy is transferred from the steam.\nIf we put some water in an open beaker, it evaporates \nuntil none is left. But what happens when we allow water \nto evaporate in a closed container?\nAt first, water molecules escape from the surface of the \nliquid to become vapour (Figure 5.5a). As more and more \nmolecules escape, the molecules in the vapour become \ncloser together. Eventually the molecules with lower \nkinetic energy will not be able to overcome the attractive \nforces of neighbouring molecules. The vapour begins to \ncondense. So some water molecules return to the liquid \n(Figure 5.5b). Eventually, water molecules return to the \nliquid at the same rate as water molecules escape to the\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nvapour. A position of equilibrium is reached (Figure 5.5c; \nsee Chapter 8).\na\nb\nc\nFigure 5.5  a  Water molecules move from liquid to vapour. \nb  As more molecules move from liquid to vapour, some begin \nto move back to the liquid. c An equilibrium is reached with \nmolecules going from liquid to vapour at the same rate as \nfrom vapour to liquid.\nAt equilibrium the concentration of water molecules in the \nvapour remains constant.\nequal rate of movement\nwater molecules in liquid \n water molecules in vapour\nIn this situation the pressure exerted by a vapour in \nequilibrium with its liquid is called its vapour pressure. \nThe vapour pressure is caused by the gas particles hitting \nthe walls of the container. Vapour pressure will increase \nwhen the temperature increases because:\n78\n■\n■\nthe gas particles have more kinetic energy\n■\n■\nthe gas particles move faster, so are able to overcome \nintermolecular forces of attraction more easily.\nThe temperature at which the vapour pressure is equal to \nthe atmospheric pressure is the boiling point of the liquid.\nQuestion\n8\t \u0007Bromine is a reddish-brown liquid. Some liquid \nbromine is placed in a closed jar. The bromine starts  \nto evaporate. The colour of the vapour above the \nliquid bromine becomes darker and darker. After a \ntime the bromine vapour does not get any darker.\n\u0007Use ideas about moving particles to explain  \nthese observations.\nThe solid state\nMany ionic, metallic and covalent compounds are \ncrystalline. The regular structure of crystals is due to the \nregular packing of the particles within the crystal. We call \nthis regularly repeating arrangement of ions, atoms or \nmolecules a crystal lattice.\n\nIonic lattices\nIonic lattices have a three-dimensional arrangement of \nalternating positive and negative ions. Compounds with \nionic lattices are sometimes called giant ionic structures.\nThe type of lattice formed depends on the relative sizes \nof the ions present. The ionic lattices for sodium chloride \nand magnesium oxide are cubic. In sodium chloride, \neach sodium ion is surrounded by six oppositely charged \nchloride ions. The chloride ions are much larger than the \nsodium ions. The sodium ions fit into the spaces between \nthe chloride ions so that they are as close as possible to \nthem (Figure 5.6).\na\nb\nNa\n+\nCl–\nCl–\nNa\n+\nCl–\nNa\n+\nCl–\nNa\n+\nCl–\nNa\n+\nNa\n+\nCl–\nNa\n+\nCl–\nCl–\nNa\n+\nNa\n+\nCl–\nFigure 5.6  The arrangement of the ions in sodium chloride: \na  the actual packing of the ions; b  an ‘exploded’ view so that \nyou can see the arrangement of the ions clearly.\nMagnesium oxide has the same lattice structure as sodium \nchloride. Magnesium ions replace sodium ions and the \noxide ions replace the chloride ions.\nThe properties of ionic compounds reflect their \nstructure as well as their bonding.\n■\n■\nThey are hard. It takes a lot of energy to scratch the  \nsurface because of the strong attractive forces keeping the \nions together.\n■\n■\nThey are brittle. Ionic crystals may split apart when hit in \nthe same direction as the layers of ions. The layers of ions \nmay be displaced by the force of the blow so that ions with \nthe same charge come together. The repulsions between \nthousands of ions in the layers, all with the same charge, \ncause the crystal to split along these cleavage planes.\n■\n■\nThey have high melting points and high boiling points \nbecause the attraction between the large numbers of \noppositely charged ions in the lattice acts in all directions \nand bonds them strongly together. The melting points \nand boiling points increase with the charge density on the \nions. So magnesium oxide, Mg2+O2–, has a higher melting \npoint (2852 °C) than sodium chloride, Na+Cl– (801 °C). \nThis is because there is a greater electrostatic attraction \nbetween doubly charged ions than singly charged ions of \nsimilar size.\n■\n■\nMany of them are soluble in water (see page 265).\n■\n■\nThey only conduct electricity when molten or in solution \n(see page 67).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nFigure 5.7  Sapphires sparkle in the light when polished. They \nare cut by exerting a force on the cleavage planes between \nlayers of ions in the crystal.\nMetallic lattices\nIn Chapter 4, we learnt that a metallic lattice consists of \nions surrounded by a sea of electrons. The ions are often \npacked in hexagonal layers or in a cubic arrangement. \nWhen a force is applied, the layers can slide over each \nother. But in a metallic bond, the attractive forces between \nthe metal ions and the delocalised electrons act in all \ndirections. So when the layers slide, new metallic bonds \nare easily re-formed between ions in new lattice positions \nand the delocalised electrons (Figure 5.8). The delocalised \nelectrons continue to hold the ions in the lattice together. \nThe metal now has a different shape. This explains why \nmetals are malleable (they can be hammered into different \nshapes) and ductile (they can be drawn into wires). The \nhigh tensile strength and hardness of most metals is also \ndue to the strong attractive forces between the metal ions \nand the delocalised electrons.\n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n–\n– \n– \n– \n– \n–\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n– \n– \n–\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nforce\napplied\n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n–\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n– \n– \n– \n– – \n– \n– \n– \n– \n–\n– \n–\nFigure 5.8  When a force is applied to a metallic structure, \nthe layers slide over each other and re-form in new lattice \npositions.\n\nChapter 5: States of matter\nFigure 5.9  You can clearly see the metal crystals or ‘grains’ in \nthis metal plate.\nAlloys and their properties\nAn alloy is a mixture of two or more metals or a metal \nwith a non-metal. The metal added to create the alloy \nbecomes part of the crystal lattice of the other metal.\nBrass is an alloy of copper (70%) with zinc (30%). \nIt is stronger than copper but still malleable. For these \nreasons it is used for musical instruments, ornaments and \nhousehold items such as door handles.\nBut why is brass stronger than pure copper?\nZinc ions are larger than copper ions. The presence \nof different-sized metal ions makes the arrangement of \nthe lattice less regular. This stops the layers of ions from \nsliding over each other so easily when a force is applied \n(Figure 5.10).\n79\nforce\npure metal\nlayers slide\nlayers cannot slide\nvery easily\nforce\nalloy\nFigure 5.10  The layers of ions in an alloy slide less easily  \nthan in a pure metal because the structure of the lattice is  \nless regular.\nPure aluminium is soft, ductile and has high electrical and \nthermal conductivity. Because of its low strength, pure \naluminium is of little use in engineering. But its strength \ncan be increased by addition of other elements such as \ncopper, magnesium, silicon and manganese. Many alloys \nof aluminium are lightweight, strong and resistant to \ncorrosion. These are used for the bodies of aircraft, for the\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\ncylinder blocks of car engines and for bicycle frames, all \nsituations where low density combined with strength and \ncorrosion resistance is important.\nBronze is an alloy of copper and tin. A 33-metre high \nbronze statue was built near the harbour in Rhodes (Greece) \nover 2000 years ago. The statue fell down after an earthquake \nand was eventually bought by a Syrian merchant. The bronze \nwas recycled to make useful implements.\nQuestion\n9\t \u0007Explain the following:\n\u0007a\t \u0007why are most metals strong, but ionic solids  \nare brittle?\n\u0007b\t \u0007why is an alloy of copper and tin stronger than \neither copper or tin alone?\nSimple molecular lattices\nSubstances with a simple molecular structure, such as \niodine, can also form crystals (Figure 5.11). This reflects \nthe regular packing of the molecules in a lattice structure.\n80\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nFigure 5.11  Iodine molecules are arranged in a  \nlattice structure.\nIce also forms a crystalline lattice. Ice and water have \npeculiar properties because of hydrogen bonding (see  \npage 66).\nThe distance between the nuclei of neighbouring iodine \nmolecules is greater than the distance between the nuclei \nwithin the iodine molecule. This is because the forces \nbetween the molecules are weak van der Waals’ forces \nwhereas the forces between the atoms within the molecule \nare strong covalent bonds. Very little energy is needed \nto overcome the weak van der Waals’ forces between the \nmolecules. The lattice is easily broken down when iodine \ncrystals are heated; iodine has a low melting point.\n\nQuestion\n10\t \u0007The table shows some properties of four elements. \nUse the data to answer the following questions. \n(Assume that steel has similar properties to iron.)\nElement\nDensity  / \n g cm–3\nTensile \nstrength / \n 1010 Pa\nElectrical \nconductivity  / \n108 S m–1\naluminium\n2.70\n7.0\n0.38\niron\n7.86\n21.1\n0.10\ncopper\n8.92\n13.0\n0.59\nsulfur\n2.07\nbreaks \neasily\n1 × 10–23\na\t \u0007Why is aluminium with a steel core used for \noverhead electricity cables in preference  \nto copper?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Suggest why many car engine blocks are made \nfrom aluminium alloys rather than from steel.\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Explain the differences in tensile strength and \nelectrical conductivity of iron and sulfur.\nGiant molecular structures\nSome covalently bonded structures have a three-\ndimensional network of covalent bonds throughout  \nthe whole structure. We call these structures giant \nmolecular structures or giant covalent structures.  \nThey have high melting and boiling points because of  \nthe large number of strong covalent bonds linking the \nwhole structure. Both elements, such as carbon (graphite \nand diamond), and compounds, such as silicon dioxide, \ncan be giant molecular structures. Carbon and graphite \nare different forms of the same element. Different \ncrystalline or molecular forms of the same element are \ncalled allotropes.\nGraphite\nIn graphite, the carbon atoms are arranged in planar \nlayers. Within the layers, the carbon atoms are arranged \nin hexagons. Each carbon atom is joined to three other \ncarbon atoms by strong covalent bonds (Figure 5.12). The \nfourth electron of each carbon atom occupies a p orbital. \nThese p orbitals on every carbon atom in each planar \nlayer overlap sideways. A cloud of delocalised electrons \nis formed above and below the plane of the carbon rings. \nThese electron clouds join up to form extended delocalised \nrings of electrons.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nFigure 5.12  The structure of graphite.\nThe layers of carbon atoms are kept next to each other by \nweak van der Waals’ forces.\nThe properties of graphite are related to its structure.\n■\n■\nHigh melting and boiling points: there is strong covalent \nbonding throughout the layers of carbon atoms. A lot of \nenergy is needed to overcome these strong bonds.\n■\n■\nSoftness: graphite is easily scratched. The forces between \nthe layers of carbon atoms are weak. The layers of graphite \ncan slide over each other when a force is applied. The layers \nreadily flake off. This ‘flakiness’ is why graphite is used in \npencil ‘leads’ and feels slippery.\n■\n■\nGood conductor of electricity: when a voltage is applied, the \ndelocalised electrons (mobile electrons) can move along  \nthe layers.\nDiamond\nIn diamond, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds \nwith other carbon atoms (Figure 5.13). The carbon atoms \nare tetrahedrally arranged around each other. The network \nof carbon atoms extends almost unbroken throughout the \nwhole structure. The regular arrangement of the atoms \ngives diamond a crystalline structure.\nFigure 5.13  The structure of diamond.\nThe properties of diamond are related to its structure.\n■\n■\nHigh melting and boiling points: there is strong covalent \nbonding throughout the whole structure. A lot of energy is \nneeded to break these strong bonds and separate the atoms.\n\nChapter 5: States of matter\n■\n■\nHardness: diamond cannot be scratched easily because it is \ndifficult to break the three-dimensional network of strong \ncovalent bonds.\n■\n■\nDoes not conduct electricity or heat: each of the four outer \nelectrons on every carbon atom is involved in covalent \nbonding. This means that there are no free electrons \navailable to carry the electric current.\nMost of the diamonds used around the world have \nbeen mined from the Earth’s crust. However, artificial \ndiamonds can be made by heating other forms of carbon \nunder high pressure. Artificial diamonds are too small to \nbe used for jewellery but they can be used for drill tips.\nSilicon(IV) oxide\nThere are several forms of silicon(IV) oxide. The silicon(IV) \noxide found in the mineral quartz (Figure 5.14) has a \nstructure similar to diamond (Figure 5.15).\n81\nFigure 5.14  The shape of these quartz crystals reflects the \nregular arrangement of the silicon and oxygen atoms.\nO\nSi\nFigure 5.15  The structure of silicon(IV) oxide.\nEach silicon atom is bonded to four oxygen atoms but \neach oxygen atom is bonded to only two silicon atoms.

In recent years, substances called fullerenes have \nbeen made. The structure of many fullerenes is based \non rings of carbon atoms, as is the structure of graphite. \nBut many fullerenes exhibit properties unlike those of \ngraphite. The individual particles in fullerenes may have \none of their dimensions between 0.1 and 100 nanometres \n(1 nanometre = 10–9 m). Particles of this size are called \nnanoparticles. Another form of carbon, graphene, can be \nregarded as a single layer of graphite.\n\nFullerenes\nFullerenes are allotropes of carbon in the form of hollow \nspheres or tubes. They are similar in structure to graphite, \nin that each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon \natoms. They contain rings of carbon atoms arranged \nin hexagons and in addition many contain rings of \ncarbon atoms arranged in pentagons. The first fullerene \ndiscovered was called buckminsterfullerene, C60 (Figure \n5.16). The C60 molecule has the shape of a football (soccer \nball). The carbon atoms are arranged at the corners of \n20 hexagons and 12 pentagons. The bonds where two \nhexagons join are shorter than the bonds between the \nhexagons and the pentagons. As in graphite, some of the \nelectrons in C60 are delocalised, but to a lesser extent than \nin graphite. Since the discovery of the C60 molecule, many \ntypes of buckminsterfullerene have been discovered. Some \nare ball-shaped molecules that are multiples of C60, e.g. \nC120. Other fullerene molecules include C20, C70 and C72.\na\nb\nFigure 5.16  The shape of a buckminsterfullerene molecule, \nC60, a is similar to that of a football b.\nThe properties of buckminsterfullerene are significantly \ndifferent from those of graphite and diamond.\n■\n■\nIt has a relatively low sublimation point: it turns directly \nfrom the solid to the vapour state when heated to about \n600 °C. (Graphite only turns from the solid to the vapour \nstate at about 3700 °C). This is because there are weak  \nvan der Waal’s forces between each buckminsterfullerene \nmolecule and no continuous layered giant structure as  \nin graphite.\n■\n■\nIt is relatively soft because it does not require much energy \nto overcome the weak intermolecular forces.\n■\n■\nIt is a poor conductor of electricity compared with graphite \nbecause the extent of electron delocalisation is lower.\n■\n■\nIt is slightly soluble in solvents such as carbon disulphide \nand methylbenzene. Neither diamond nor graphite is \nsoluble in common solvents.\n■\n■\nIt is more reactive compared with graphite or diamond. \nBuckminsterfullerene reacts with hydrogen, fluorine, \nchlorine, bromine and oxygen. This is due to the relatively\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nhigh electron density in certain parts of the molecule (see \nelectrophilic addition on page 209).\nA second type of fullerene is a class of molecules described \nas nanotubes. Nanotubes are fullerenes of hexagonally \narranged carbon atoms like a single layer of graphite \nbent into the form of a cylinder (Figure 5.17). The first \nnanotubes to be made were one layer of carbon atoms in \nthickness. More recently nanotubes have behave been made \nwith thicker walls with several tubes inside one another. \nAlthough the diameter of a nanotube is very small, it \ncan be made relatively long. The length of the nanotube \ncylinder can be a million times greater than its diameter.\nFigure 5.17  Part of the structure of a nanotube. The ends of \nthe cylinder are often closed.\nNanotubes have characteristic properties:\n■\n■\nThey have high electrical conductivity along the long axis \nof the cylinder. This is because, like graphite, some of the \nelectrons are delocalised and are able to move along the \ncylinder when a voltage is applied.\n■\n■\nThey have a very high tensile strength when a force is \napplied along the long axis of the cylinder. They can be up to \n100 times stronger than steel of the same thickness.\n■\n■\nThey have very high melting points (typically about 3500 °C). \nThis is because there is strong covalent bonding throughout \nthe structure.\nFullerenes have a large range of potential uses. \nReactive groups can be attached to their surfaces and \nmetal complexes (see page 371) can also be formed. \nSmall molecules or atoms can be trapped in the cage \nof buckminsterfullerenes. Possible medical uses \ninclude delivering drugs to specific places in the body. \nNanotubes are used in tiny electrical circuits as ‘wires’ \nand as electrodes in paper-thin batteries. They can be \nincorporated into clothing and sports equipment for added \nstrength. They have also been used in the treatment of \ncertain types of cancer.\n\nChapter 5: States of matter\nGraphene\nGraphene is a single isolated layer of graphite (Figure 5.18). \nThe hexagonally arranged sheet of carbon atoms is not \ncompletely rigid and it can be distorted.\na\nb\nFigure 5.18  a  Part of a graphene sheet. b  ‘Waves’ in a sheet \nof graphene.\nGraphene has some of the properties of graphite, but they \nare more exaggerated. For example:\n■\n■\nGraphene is the most chemically reactive form of carbon. \nSingle sheets of graphene burn at very low temperatures \nand are much more reactive than graphite.\n■\n■\nGraphene is extremely strong for its mass.\n83\n■\n■\nFor a given amount of material, graphene conducts \nelectricity and heat much better than graphite.\nIt has been said that ‘a one square metre hammock made \nof graphene could support a 4 kg cat but would weigh \nonly as much as the cat’s whisker’. Potential applications \nof graphene include use in tiny electrical circuits and for \ntiny transistors, touchscreens, solar cells and other energy \nstorage devices.\nQuestion\n13\t \u0007Suggest, using ideas of structure and bonding, why:\n\u0007a\t \u0007buckminsterfullerene, C60, is converted from a \nsolid to a gas at a relatively low temperature\n\u0007b\t \u0007graphene is a good conductor of electricity\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007nanotubes conduct electricity better along the \nlong axis of the tube than across the tube\n\u0007d\t \u0007buckminsterfullerene, C60, is relatively soft.\nConserving materials\nWhy conserve materials?\nThere is only a limited supply of metal ores in the Earth. \nIf we use them all up, they cannot be replaced. The things \nwe make from metals and other materials from the\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nEarth’s crust are often thrown away. This leads to huge \nwaste dumps and landfill sites scarring the landscape \nand problems with litter. Extracting metals from their \nores requires a lot of energy. Energy resources are also \nlimited and we need to conserve these as well. One way \nto help conserve materials and energy is to recycle metals \n(Figure 5.19).\n84\nFigure 5.19  Remember to recycle your cans. As well as \naluminium cans, we can also save energy and resources by \nrecycling steel cans.\nRecycling materials\nLarge amounts of energy are needed to extract and purify \nmetals. It is often cheaper to collect used metals and \nrecycle them rather than extract them from their ores.\nRecycling has several advantages:\n■\n■\nit saves energy (this helps tackle global warming, as we burn \nless fossil fuel)\n■\n■\nit conserves supplies of the ore\n\n■\n■\nlandfill sites do not get filled up as fast and there is  \nless waste\n■\n■\nit is cheaper than extracting the metal from the ore.\nIt is not always easy to recycle metals. They have to be \ncollected and sorted and then transported to the recycling \nplant. This takes energy and money. It may be difficult \nto separate individual metals. For example ‘tin’ cans are \nmade from steel coated with tin. The two metals have to be \nseparated before they can be used again. Two metals that \ncan be recycled easily are copper and aluminium.\nCopper\nMost copper ores remaining in the Earth contain less than \n1% copper. Recycling copper is important because:\n■\n■\nless energy is needed to recycle copper than is needed \nto transport copper ore to the smelting plant and extract \ncopper from it\n■\n■\nless energy is needed to extract and refine the recycled \ncopper so that it is pure enough to be electrolysed.\nThe copper used for water pipes and cooking utensils \ndoes not have to be very pure, so little purification of \nrecycled copper is needed for these uses. The copper used \nfor electrical wiring has to be 99.99% pure. This has to be \npurified by electrolysis.\nAluminium\nPurifying and remoulding aluminium is much cheaper  \nthan extracting aluminium from bauxite ore. Savings are \nmade because:\n■\n■\nit is not necessary to extract the aluminium ore from \nthe ground or to transport it to the smelting plant; these \nprocesses require energy\n■\n■\nthe treatment of bauxite to make pure aluminium oxide for \nelectrolysis does not need to be carried out\n■\n■\nthe aluminium scrap needs less energy to melt it, compared \nwith melting aluminium oxide\n■\n■\nthe expensive electrolysis of aluminium oxide does not need \nto be carried out .\nThere is a 95% saving in energy if we recycle aluminium \nrather than extract it from its ore.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nSummary\n■ The kinetic theory of gases states that gas particles \nare always in constant random motion at a variety \nof speeds.\n■ The volume of a gas increases when the \ntemperature increases and decreases when the \npressure increases.\n■ The volume of a gas under different conditions of \ntemperature and pressure can be calculated using \nthe ideal gas equation pV = nRT.\n■ The ideal gas equation can be used to determine the \nrelative molecular mass of simple molecules.\n■ Gases do not obey the ideal gas equation at low \ntemperatures and high pressures.\n■ The kinetic-molecular model can be used to describe \nthe states of matter in terms of proximity and motion \nof the particles, and to describe changes of state and \nvapour pressure.\n■ Ionic compounds such as sodium chloride and \nmagnesium oxide form a giant three-dimensional \nlattice structure containing ions in a regularly \nrepeating pattern.\n■ The strong ionic forces acting in all directions \nbetween the ions in the lattice cause ionic \nsubstances to have high melting and boiling points.\nEnd-of-chapter questions\n1 Four types of structure are:\n \ngiant molecular\n \ngiant ionic\n \ngiant metallic\n \nsimple molecular\n \na  Give two examples of a giant ionic structure and two examples of a simple molecular structure. \n[4]\n \nb  Explain why substances with giant ionic structures are often brittle but metallic structures are malleable.

Energy can take many forms, including heat, \nlight, sound and electrical energy. The chemical energy \nin the atoms and bonds of a substance is also very \nimportant. One of the most obvious energy transfers in \nchemical reactions is the transfer of heat (Figure 6.1). \nA car engine gets hot when the energy is transferred \nfrom the burning fuel. Fireworks release a lot of energy \nas heat (as well as light and sound) when they explode. \nOur bodies keep warm because of the continuous \noxidation of the food we eat.\nWhat are enthalpy changes?\nExothermic or endothermic?\nChemical reactions that release energy to the surroundings \nare described as exothermic. In an exothermic reaction \nthe temperature of the surroundings increases. For \nexample, when magnesium reacts with sulfuric acid \nin a test tube, the energy released is transferred to the \nsurroundings and the temperature of the reaction mixture \nin the tube increases.\n90\nMg(s)  +  H2SO4(aq)\nMgSO4(aq)  +  H2(g)  (energy released)\nThe surroundings include:\n■\n■\nthe solvent (in this case water)\n■\n■\nthe air around the test tube\n■\n■\nthe test tube itself\n■\n■\nanything dipping into the test tube (e.g. a thermometer).\nOther examples of exothermic reactions include:\n■\n■\nthe combustion of fuels\n■\n■\nthe oxidation of carbohydrates in the bodies of animals and \nplants (respiration)\n■\n■\nthe reaction of water with quicklime (calcium oxide) (see \npage 166).\nChemical reactions that absorb energy from the \nsurroundings are described as endothermic. In an \nendothermic reaction the temperature of the surroundings \ndecreases (Figure 6.2). For example, when sodium\n\nFigure 6.1  The chemical reactions in this fire are releasing \nlarge quantities of energy.\nhydrogencarbonate reacts with an aqueous solution of \ncitric acid in a test tube the temperature of the reaction \nmixture in the tube decreases.

Enthalpy is the total energy associated with \nthe materials that react. The symbol for enthalpy is H. \nWe cannot measure enthalpy, but we can measure an \nenthalpy change when heat energy is exchanged with the \nsurroundings. We can write this as:\n\t\nΔH\t\n=\t\nHproducts\t\n–\t Hreactants\nenthalpy\t\n\t\nenthalpy of\t\n\t\nenthalpy of\n\t\nchange\t\n\t\nproducts\t\n\t\nreactants\nThe symbol Δ is the upper case Greek letter ‘delta’. This \nsymbol is often used to mean a change in a quantity.  \nFor example, ΔT means a change in temperature and ΔH \nmeans the enthalpy change.\nThe units of enthalpy change are kilojoules per mole \n(kJ mol–1).\nWe can draw enthalpy profile diagrams (also known \nas reaction pathway diagrams) to show enthalpy changes. \nThe enthalpy of the reactants and products is shown \non the y-axis. The x-axis shows the reaction pathway, \nwith reactants on the left and products on the right. \nFor an exothermic reaction, energy is released to the \nsurroundings. So the enthalpy of the reactants must be \ngreater than the enthalpy of the products. We can see \nfrom the enthalpy profile diagram for the combustion of \nmethane (Figure 6.3) that Hproducts – Hreactants is negative.\nWe can include this information in the equation for  \nthe reaction:\nCH4(g)  +  2O2(g)  \n  CO2(g)  +  2H2O(l)\nΔH = –890.3 kJ mol–1\nThe negative sign shows that the reaction is exothermic.\nFor an endothermic reaction, energy is absorbed from \nthe surroundings by the chemicals in the reaction.

This is called the First Law \nof Thermodynamics.\nThis law also applies to chemical reactions. The total \nenergy of the chemicals and their surroundings must \nremain constant. In 1840 Germain Hess applied the Law of \nConservation of Energy to enthalpy changes.\nHess’s law states that ‘the total enthalpy change in a \nchemical reaction is independent of the route by which \nthe chemical reaction takes place as long as the initial and \nfinal conditions are the same’.\nEnthalpy cycles\nWe can illustrate Hess’s law by drawing enthalpy cycles \n(Hess cycles). In Figure 6.7, the reactants A and B combine \ndirectly to form C. This is the direct route.\nTwo indirect routes are also shown.

We can still use Hess’s law.\nWe can use Hess’s law to calculate enthalpy  \nchanges that cannot be found by experiments using \ncalorimetry.

Breaking bonds requires energy. The energy \nis needed to overcome the attractive forces joining the \natoms together. Energy is released when new bonds are \nformed. Bond breaking is endothermic and bond forming \nis exothermic.\nIn a chemical reaction:\n■\n■\nif the energy needed to break bonds is less than the energy \nreleased when new bonds are formed, the reaction will \nrelease energy and is exothermic.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\n■\n■\nif the energy needed to break bonds is more than the \nenergy released when new bonds are formed, the reaction \nwill absorb energy and is endothermic.\nWe can draw enthalpy level (reaction pathway) diagrams \nto show these changes (Figure 6.14). In reality, not all the \nbonds in a compound are broken and then re-formed \nduring a reaction. In most reactions only some of the bonds \nin the reactants are broken and then new bonds are formed \nin a specific sequence. The minimum energy required to \nbreak certain bonds in a compound to get a reaction to \nstart is called the activation energy (see page 141).\nBond energy\nThe amount of energy needed to break a specific covalent \nbond is called the bond dissociation energy. We sometimes \ncall this the bond energy or bond enthalpy. The symbol \nfor bond energy is E. We put the type of bond broken in \nbrackets after the symbol. So E(C   H) refers to the bond \nenergy of a mole of single bonds between carbon and \nhydrogen atoms.\nThe bond energy for double and triple bonds refers to a \nmole of double or triple bonds. Two examples of equations \nrelating to bond energies are:\n100\nBr2(g)  \n  2Br(g)\t\nE(Br   Br) = +193 kJ mol–1\nO   O(g)  \n  2O(g)\t E(O   O) = +498 kJ mol–1\nThe values of bond energies are always positive because \nthey refer to bonds being broken.\nWhen new bonds are formed the amount of energy \nreleased is the same as the amount of energy absorbed \nwhen the same type of bond is broken. So, for the \nformation of oxygen molecules from oxygen atoms:\n2O(g)  \n  O2(g)\t\nE(O   O) = –498 kJ mol–1\na\nb\nC + 4H + 4O\nbond \nbreaking\nH\nH + O O\nO O\nH C\nEnergy\nbond\nforming\nH\nenergy\nreleased\nO\nH\nH\nO\nH\nH\n+\nC\nO\nO\nReaction pathway\nFigure 6.14  a  An energy level diagram showing bond breaking and bond forming for the combustion of methane (exothermic). \nb  An energy level diagram showing bond breaking and bond forming for the decomposition of hydrogen bromide (endothermic).\n\nAverage bond energy\nBond energy is affected by other atoms in the molecule. The \nO   H bond in water has a slightly different bond energy \nvalue to the O   H bond in ethanol; in ethanol the oxygen is \nconnected to a carbon atom rather than another hydrogen \natom. The O   H bond is in a different environment. \nIdentical bonds in molecules with two (or more) types of \nbond have different bond energies when we measure them. \nIt takes more energy to break the first O   H bond in water \nthan to break the second. For these reasons we use average \nbond energies taken from a number of bonds of the same \ntype but in different environments.\nWe cannot usually find the value of bond energies \ndirectly so we have to use an enthalpy cycle. The average \nbond energy of the C   H bond in methane can be found \nusing the enthalpy changes of atomisation of carbon and \nhydrogen and the enthalpy change of combustion or \nformation of methane.\nThe enthalpy cycle for calculating the average C   H \nbond energy is shown in Figure 6.15. Using the enthalpy \ncycle shown in Figure 6.15, the average C   H bond energy \ncan be found by dividing the value of ΔH on the diagram \nby four (because there are four C   H bonds in a molecule \nof methane).\nCH4(g)\n∆H\nC(g) + 4H(g)\n∆Hf [CH4(g)] \n∆Hat [(graphite)]\n+ 4∆Hat [  H2(g)]\n1\n2\nC(graphite) + 2H2(g)\nFigure 6.15  An enthalpy cycle to find the average bond \nenergy of the C   H bond.

Rusting is an oxidation \nreaction that destroys about 20% of iron and steel \nevery year. Rust is hydrated iron(III) oxide. This forms \nwhen iron reacts with oxygen in the presence of water.\nAnother costly example of oxidation is the reaction \nbetween hydrogen and oxygen that is used to propel \nsome types of rockets into space. In this reaction, the \nhydrogen is oxidised – but the oxygen is also reduced. \nIn fact, oxidation and reduction always take place \ntogether, in what we call redox reactions.\nFigure 7.1  A redox reaction is taking place when the fuel in \nthe Space Shuttle’s rockets burns.\nWhat is a redox reaction?\nA simple definition of oxidation is gain of oxygen by \nan element. For example, when magnesium reacts with \noxygen, the magnesium combines with oxygen to form \nmagnesium oxide. Magnesium has been oxidised.\n2Mg(s)  +  O2(g)  \n  2MgO(s)\nA simple definition of reduction is loss of oxygen. When \ncopper(II) oxide reacts with hydrogen, this is the equation \nfor the reaction:\nCuO(s)  +  H2(g)  \n  Cu(s)  +  H2O(l)\nCopper(II) oxide loses its oxygen. Copper(II) oxide has \nbeen reduced.\nBut if we look carefully at the copper oxide/hydrogen \nequation, we can see that oxidation is also taking place. \nThe hydrogen is gaining oxygen to form water. The \nhydrogen has been oxidised. We can see that reduction \nand oxidation have taken place together.\nOxidation and reduction always take place together. \nWe call the reactions in which this happens redox \nreactions. Redox reactions are very important. For \nexample, one redox reaction – photosynthesis – provides \nfood for the entire planet, and another one – respiration – \nkeeps you alive. both are redox reactions.\n\nChapter 7: Redox reactions\n107\nWe can also define reduction as addition of hydrogen to \na compound and oxidation as removal of hydrogen from \na compound. This is often seen in the reaction of organic \ncompounds (see page 237).\nThere are two other ways of finding out whether or \nnot a substance has been oxidised or reduced during a \nchemical reaction:\n■\n■\nelectron transfer\n■\n■\nchanges in oxidation number.\nQuestion\n1\t \u0007a\t \u0007In each of the following equations, state which \nreactant has been oxidised:\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007PbO  +  H2  \n  Pb  +  H2O\n\u0007ii\t \u0007CO  +  Ag2O  \n  2Ag  +  CO2\n\t\n\t\n\u0007iii\t \u00072Mg  +   CO2  \n  2MgO  +  C\n\u0007b\t \u0007In each of the following equations, state which \nreactant has been reduced:\n\u0007i\t\n\u00075CO  +  I2O2  \n  5CO2  +  I2\n\t\n\t\n\u0007ii\t \u00072H2S  +  SO2  \n  3S  +  2H2O\n\u0007iii\t \u0007CH2   CH2  +  H2  \n  CH3CH3\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nRedox and electron transfer\nHalf-equations\nWe can extend our definition of redox to include reactions \ninvolving ions.\nOxidation Is Loss of electrons.\nReduction Is Gain of electrons.\nThe initial letters shown in bold spell OIL RIG.

We do this by using oxidation numbers \n(oxidation numbers are also called oxidation states). An \noxidation number is a number given to each atom or ion in a \ncompound that shows us its degree of oxidation. Oxidation \nnumbers can be positive, negative or zero. The + or – sign must \nalways be included. Higher positive oxidation numbers mean \nthat an atom or ion is more oxidised. Higher negative oxidation \nnumbers mean that an atom or ion is more reduced.\nOxidation number rules\nWe can deduce the oxidation number of any atom or  \nion by using oxidation number rules. It is important to  \nnote that an oxidation number refers to a single atom in  \na compound.\n1\t The oxidation number of any uncombined element is \nzero. For example, the oxidation number of each atom \nin S8, Cl2 and Zn is zero.\n2\t In compounds many atoms or ions have fixed \noxidation numbers\n–\t Group 1 elements are always +1\n–\t Group 2 elements are always +2\n–\t fluorine is always –1\n–\t hydrogen is +1 (except in metal hydrides such as \nNaH, where it is –1)\n–\t oxygen is –2 (except in peroxides, where it is –1, and \nin F2O, where it is +2).\n3\t The oxidation number of an element in a monatomic \nion is always the same as the charge. For example,  \nCl– is –1, Al3+ is +3.\n\nChapter 7: Redox reactions\n4\t The sum of the oxidation numbers in a compound  \nis zero.\n5\t The sum of the oxidation numbers in an ion is equal to \nthe charge on the ion.\n6\t In either a compound or an ion, the more \nelectronegative element is given the negative  \noxidation number.\nFigure 7.2  This is part of a ship’s hull. It is made of iron \nprotected by bars of magnesium metal. The magnesium \natoms (oxidation number = 0) are oxidised to Mg2+ ions \n(oxidation number = +2) in preference to iron atoms changing \nto Fe3+. This is called sacrificial protection.\n109\nApplying the oxidation number rules\nIn the following examples we shall use ‘ox. no.’ as an \nabbreviation for oxidation number.\nCompounds of a metal with a non-metal\nThe metal always has the positive ox. no. and the non-\nmetal has the negative ox. no.

For \nexample, when magnesium reacts with excess \nhydrochloric acid, the reaction stops when all the \nmagnesium has been used up. The products cannot be \nconverted back to the reactants. This reaction  \nis irreversible.\nHowever, some reactions can be reversed. There is \nthe forward reaction, where reactants are converted \ninto products, and the reverse reaction, where the \nproducts are converted back into the reactants. When \nthe rates of the forward and reverse reactions balance, \nwe say the reversible reaction is in equilibrium.\nIt may help to think of other situations in which forces \nor processes are in equilibrium (Figure 8.1).\nReversible reactions and \nequilibrium\nReversible reactions\nSome reactions can be reversed. For example, when  \nblue, hydrated copper(II) sulfate is heated, it loses its \nwater of crystallisation and changes to white, anhydrous \ncopper(II) sulfate.\nCuSO4.5H2O(s)\t\n\t CuSO4(s)\t\n+\t 5H2O(l)\nhydrated copper(II)\t\t\nanhydrous\nsulfate\t\t\ncopper(II) sulfate\nThis is called the forward reaction.\nWhen water is added to anhydrous copper(II) sulfate, \nthe reaction is reversed.\nCuSO4(s)  +  5H2O(l)  \n  CuSO4.5H2O(s)\nThis is called the backward (or reverse) reaction.\nWe can show these two reactions in the same equation \nby using two arrows.\nCuSO4.5H2O(s)  \n  CuSO4(s)  +  5H2O(l)\nFigure 8.2  Hydrated copper(II) sulfate (left) and anhydrous \ncopper(II) sulfate (right).\n\nChapter 8: Equilibrium\nFigure 8.1  Both the moving belt and runner are moving. \nWhen the movement of the belt balances the movement of \nthe runner, they are in equilibrium.\nA reaction in which the products can react to re-form the \noriginal reactants is called a reversible reaction. In this \ncase heating and adding water are not being carried out \nat the same time. However, there is a type of chemical \nreaction in which the forward reaction and the backward \nreaction take place at the same time.\nIn many chemical reactions the reactants are not \nused up completely. Some products are formed but the \nmaximum theoretical yield is not obtained. A mixture \nof products and reactants is formed. The products react \ntogether to re-form reactants at the same time as the \nreactants are forming products. This type of reversible \nreaction is called an equilibrium reaction. We show that \nequilibrium reactions are reversible by the sign \n.\nFor example, consider the reaction between hydrogen \nand iodine carried out in a sealed glass tube at 400 °C:\n117\nH2(g)  +  I2(g)  \n  2HI(g)\nMolecules of hydrogen iodide are breaking down to \nhydrogen and iodine at the same rate as hydrogen  \nand iodine molecules are reacting together to form \nhydrogen iodide.\nhydrogen atom\niodine atom\nFigure 8.3  A snapshot of the dynamic equilibrium between \nhydrogen gas, iodine gas and hydrogen iodide gas.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nWhen fizzy drinks are made, carbon dioxide gas is \ndissolved in the drink under pressure.

This is because of the equilibrium\nCO2(g)  \n  CO2(aq)\nThe forward reaction happens during manufacture and the \nbackward reaction happens on opening.\nCharacteristics of equilibrium\nAn equilibrium reaction has four particular features under \nconstant conditions:\n■\n■\nit is dynamic\n■\n■\nthe forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate\n■\n■\nthe concentrations of reactants and products remain \nconstant at equilibrium\n■\n■\nit requires a closed system.\n1  It is dynamic\nThe phrase dynamic equilibrium means that the \nmolecules or ions of reactants and products are \ncontinuously reacting. Reactants are continuously being \nchanged to products and products are continuously being \nchanged back to reactants.\n118\n2  The forward and backward reactions occur \nat the same rate\nAt equilibrium the rate of the forward reaction equals \nthe rate of the backward reaction. Molecules or ions \nof reactants are becoming products, and those in the \nproducts are becoming reactants, at the same rate.\n3  The concentrations of reactants and \nproducts remain constant at equilibrium\nThe concentrations remain constant because, at \nequilibrium, the rates of the forward and backward \nreactions are equal. The equilibrium can be approached \nfrom two directions.

When any of the reactants or \nproducts are gases, changes in pressure may also affect the \nposition of equilibrium. French chemist Henri Le Chatelier \n(1850–1936) observed how these factors affect the position \nof equilibrium. He put forward a general rule, known as  \nLe Chatelier’s principle:\nIf one or more factors that affect an equilibrium is \nchanged, the position of equilibrium shifts in the direction \nthat reduces (opposes) the change.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nWe can predict the effect of changing concentration  \nand pressure by referring to the stoichiometric equation \nfor the reaction. We can predict the effect of changing  \nthe temperature by referring to the enthalpy change of  \nthe reaction.\nHow does change in concentration affect \nthe position of equilibrium?\nWhen the concentration of one or more of the reactants  \nis increased:\n■\n■\nthe system is no longer in equilibrium\n■\n■\nthe position of equilibrium moves to the right to reduce the \neffect of the increase in concentration of reactant\n■\n■\nmore products are formed until equilibrium is restored.\nWhen the concentration of one or more of the products  \nis increased:\n■\n■\nthe system is no longer in equilibrium\n■\n■\nthe position of equilibrium moves to the left to reduce the \neffect of the increase in concentration of product\n■\n■\nmore reactants are formed until equilibrium is restored.\nFor example, look at the reaction:\nCH3COOH(l)\t+\tC2H5OH(l)\t\n\tCH3COOC2H5(l)\t+\tH2O(l)\n120\nethanoic acid\t\n\t\nethanol\t\n\t\nethyl ethanoate\t\n\t\nwater\nWhat happens when we add more ethanol?\n■\n■\nThe concentration of ethanol is increased.\n■\n■\nAccording to Le Chatelier’s principle, some of the ethanol \nmust be removed to reduce the concentration of the  \nadded ethanol.\n■\n■\nThe position of equilibrium shifts to the right.\n■\n■\nMore ethanol reacts with ethanoic acid and more ethyl \nethanoate and water are formed.\nWhat happens when we add more water?\n■\n■\nThe concentration of water is increased.\n■\n■\nAccording to Le Chatelier’s principle, some of the water \nmust be removed to reduce the concentration of the  \nadded water.\n■\n■\nThe position of equilibrium shifts to the left.\n■\n■\nSo more water reacts with ethyl ethanoate and more \nethanoic acid and ethanol are formed.\nWhat happens when we remove some water?\n■\n■\nThe concentration of water is decreased.\n■\n■\nAccording to Le Chatelier’s principle, some water must be \nadded to increase its concentration.\n■\n■\nThe position of equilibrium shifts to the right.\n■\n■\nSo more ethanoic acid reacts with ethanol and more water \nand ethyl ethanoate are formed.\n\nQuestion\n3\t a\t Use this reaction:\nCH3COOH(l)  +  C2H5OH(l)\nCH3COOC2H5(l)  +  H2O(l)\n\u0007Explain what happens to the position of \nequilibrium when:\ni\t\nmore CH3COOC2H5(l) is added\nii\t some C2H5OH(l) is removed.\nb\t Use this reaction:\nCe4+(aq)  +  Fe2+(aq)  \n  Ce3+(aq)  +  Fe3+(aq)\n\u0007Explain what happens to the position of \nequilibrium when:\ni\t\nthe concentration of Fe2+(aq) ions is increased\nii\t water is added to the equilibrium mixture.\nFigure 8.7  Stalactites and stalagmites are formed as a result \nof water passing through rocks containing calcium carbonate. \nThe solution running through these rocks contains water, \ndissolved carbon dioxide and calcium hydrogencarbonate:\nCaCO3(s)  +  H2O(l)  +  CO2(aq)  \n  Ca(HCO3)2(aq)\nWhen droplets of this mixture are formed on the roof of the \ncave, some of the carbon dioxide in the droplets escapes \ninto the air.

The molecules or ions in solids \nand liquids are packed closely together and cannot be \ncompressed very easily. In gases, the molecules are far \napart (Figure 8.8).\nhigher pressure\nmeans higher\nconcentration\ngas\nlower pressure means\nlower concentration\nFigure 8.8  Pressure has a considerable effect on the \nconcentration of gases.\nThe pressure of a gas is caused by the molecules hitting the \nwalls of the container. Each molecule in a mixture of gases \ncontributes towards the total pressure. So, at constant \ntemperature, the more gas molecules there are in a given \nvolume, the higher the pressure.\nFigure 8.9 shows what happens when we increase the \npressure on the reaction represented by:\nX(g)\t\n+\t\nY(g)\t\n\t\nZ(g)\n1 mol\t\n\t\n1 mol\t\n\t\n1 mol\nIn this reaction there are two moles of gas on the left \nand one on the right.

The data gathered from rate experiments can \ngive us an insight into how reactions take place. We can \nthen make deductions about the mechanism of a reaction.\nThe rate of a reaction can be defined as follows:\nrate = ​  change in amount of reactants or products \n \n \n \n___________________________________ \n \ntime \n​\nThe balanced chemical equation gives us no information \nabout the rate of a reaction. Experiments are needed \nto measure the rate at which reactants are used up or \nproducts are formed. For example, if a reaction gives off \na gas, we can measure the volume of gas released in the \ncourse of the reaction at regular time intervals (Figure 9.2).\ngas syringe\nFigure 9.2  Measuring the volume of gas given off over time \nenables us to calculate the rate of reaction in cm3 of gas per \nsecond.\n\nChapter 9: Rates of reaction\nin industrial processes and make useful products \nefficiently and safely.\nCollision theory\nWhen we explain the effects of concentration, \ntemperature, surface area and catalysts on rates of \nreaction, we use the collision theory. Collision theory \nstates that in order to react with each other, particles \nmust collide in the correct orientation and with sufficient \nenergy. The particles might be atoms, ions or molecules.\nWhen reactant particles collide they may simply \nbounce off each other, without changing. This is called an \nunsuccessful collision. An unsuccessful collision will take \nplace if the colliding particles do not have enough energy \nto react. If the reactant particles do have enough energy to \nreact, they may change into product particles when they \ncollide. This is called a successful (or effective) collision \n(Figure 9.3).\nThe minimum energy that colliding particles must \npossess for a successful collision to take place is called the \nactivation energy of that particular reaction.\nThe activation energy for an exothermic reaction and \nan endothermic reaction can be shown on enthalpy profile \ndiagrams, as shown in Figures 9.4 and 9.5.\n141\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nFigure 9.3  a Unsuccessful and b successful (or effective) collisions.\nEnthalpy, H/kJmol–1\nactivation energy: start-up energy\n \n     ‘pump-priming’\n \n     the reaction\nreactants\n142\nproducts\n0\n0\nReaction pathway\nFigure 9.4  The activation energy in an exothermic reaction.\nFigure 9.5  The activation energy in an endothermic reaction.\nAccording to the collision theory, a reaction will speed  \nup if:\n■\n■\nthe frequency of collisions increases\n■\n■\nthe proportion of particles with energy greater than the \nactivation energy increases.\nA catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a \nreaction but remains chemically unchanged itself at \nthe end of the reaction.

The \nmore concentrated a solution, the greater the number of \nparticles of solute dissolved in a given volume of solvent. \nIn reactions involving solutions, more concentrated \nreactants have a faster rate of reaction. This is because \nthe random motion of the particles in solution results in \nmore frequent collisions between reacting particles. This is \nshown in Figure 9.7.\nThe effect of pressure in reactions involving gases is \nsimilar to the effect of concentration in solutions. As we \nincrease the pressure of reacting gases, there are more \ngas molecules in a given volume. This results in more \ncollisions in any given time, and a faster rate of reaction.\na\nb\nFigure 9.7  The particles in box a are closer together than \nthose in box b. There are more particles in the same volume, \nso the chances and frequency of collisions between reacting \nparticles are increased. Therefore, the rate of reaction is \ngreater in box a than in box b.\n\nChapter 9: Rates of reaction\nQuestion\n2\t a\t \u0007Dilute hydrochloric acid reacts with marble chips \n(calcium carbonate), giving off carbon dioxide gas. \nWhich solution of acid will have the fastest initial \nrate of reaction:\nA\t \u000750 cm3 of 0.5 mol dm−3?\nB\t \u000710 cm3 of 1.0 mol dm−3?\nC\t \u000725 cm3 of 0.5 mol dm−3?\nb\t \u0007Explain your answer to part a.\nThe effect of temperature on \nrate of reaction\nTo fully understand rates of reaction, we need to look more \nclosely at the energy possessed by the reactant particles. \nIn a sample of any substance, at a given temperature, the \nparticles will not all possess the same amount of energy \nas each other. A few particles will have a relatively small \namount of energy. A few particles will have a relatively \nlarge amount of energy. Most particles will have an \namount of energy somewhere in between. The distribution \nof energies at a given temperature can be shown on a graph \n(see Figure 9.8). This is called the Boltzmann distribution.\nIn Figure 9.8, the activation energy, Ea, is labelled. \nWe have seen that the activation energy is defined as the \nminimum energy required for colliding particles to react. \nWhen we raise the temperature of a reaction mixture, \nthe average kinetic (movement) energy of the particles \nincreases. Particles in solution and in gases will move \naround more quickly at a higher temperature, resulting in \nmore frequent collisions. However, experiments show us \nthat the effect of temperature on rate of reaction cannot \nbe totally explained by more frequent collisions. The \nkey factor is that the proportion of successful collisions\n143\nthe shaded area shows the\nproportion of molecules in\nthe sample that have enough\nenergy to cause a chemical\nchange when they collide\nNumber of molecules\nEa\n0\n0\nMolecular energy\nEa – at and above this energy\nthe molecules have enough\nenergy to collide eﬀectively\nFigure 9.8  The Boltzmann distribution of molecular energies, \nshowing the activation energy.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nincreases greatly as we increase the temperature. The \ndistribution of molecular energies changes as we raise the \ntemperature, as shown in Figure 9.9. The curve showing the \nBoltzmann distribution at the higher temperature flattens \nand the peak shifts to the right.\nThe area under the curve represents the number of \nparticles. The shaded area shows the number of particles \nwith energy greater than the activation energy, Ea. For \na 10 °C rise in temperature this area under the curve \napproximately doubles, as does the rate of many reactions.\nTherefore, increasing the temperature increases the rate \nof reaction because:\n■\n■\nthe increased energy results in particles moving around \nmore quickly, which increases the frequency of collisions\n■\n■\nthe proportion of successful collisions (i.e. those that result \nin a reaction) increases because the proportion of particles \nexceeding the activation energy increases.

However, by providing \na lower activation energy, a greater proportion of molecules\n\nNumber of molecules\ncoloured areas indicate the proportion\nof molecules whose energy exceeds\nthe activation energies Ea(cat) and Ea\nmolecules with\nthese low energies\ncannot react\nMolecular energy\nEa(cat)\nEa\n0\n0\nFigure 9.10  The Boltzmann distribution of molecular \nenergies, showing the change in activation energy with and \nwithout a catalyst.\nin the reaction mixture have sufficient energy to react. \nThe shaded area under the curve represents the numbers \nof molecules that have energy greater than the activation \nenergy of the reaction. The total shaded area (including \nboth the light and dark shading) under the curve shows the \nnumber of particles with energy greater than the activation \nenergy with the catalyst present (Ea(cat)). This area is much \nlarger than the dark shaded area for the reaction without a \ncatalyst. Therefore the rate at which effective collisions occur, \nand so the rate of the catalysed reaction, is greatly increased \ncompared with the rate of the uncatalysed reaction.\nHomogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts\nWhen a catalyst and the reactants in a catalysed reaction \nare in the same phase, the catalyst is described as a \nhomogeneous catalyst. For example, a catalyst can be \ndescribed as homogeneous if it is dissolved in water and the \nreactants are also present as an aqueous solution.\nIf the catalyst is in a different phase to the reactants, the \ncatalyst is described as a heterogeneous catalyst. You have \nprobably met an example of heterogeneous catalysis when \nmaking oxygen gas. The reaction commonly used  \nin the laboratory is the decomposition of hydrogen \nperoxide solution:\n2H2O2(aq)  \n  2H2O(l)  +  O2(g)\t\nslow reaction\nThis is a very slow reaction at room temperature. However, \nwhen a little of the insoluble solid manganese(IV) oxide \npowder, MnO2(s), is added, oxygen is given off quickly \n(Figure 9.11).\nMnO2(s)\n2H2O(l)  +  O2(g)\t fast reaction\n2H2O2(aq)\nAt the end of the reaction, when no more gas is being \nreleased, the solid catalyst can be recovered by filtering  \noff the water and drying the black powder of \nmanganese(IV) oxide.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\na\nb\nFigure 9.11  a  A solution of hydrogen peroxide at room \ntemperature. b  The solution of hydrogen peroxide with a little \nmanganese(IV) oxide added.\nMany heterogeneous catalysts are solids that catalyse \ngaseous reactants. The reactions take place on the surface \nof the solid catalyst. There are many examples in industry, \nincluding the iron catalyst used in the manufacture of \nammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas, and the \nnickel catalyst used when adding hydrogen gas to vegetable \noils to make margarine.\nEnzymes\nEnzymes are biological catalysts. They are large protein \nmolecules which enable the biochemical reactions that \nhappen in living things to take place very quickly at \nrelatively low temperatures. Most enzyme-catalysed \nreactions happen in solution and are examples of \nhomogeneous catalysis.\nIn common with inorganic catalysts, enzymes:\n■\n■\nspeed up a reaction without being used up\n■\n■\nprovide an alternative reaction pathway with a lower \nactivation energy (Figure 9.12).\nE–S\nE+P\nEnthalpy\nEa for the\nuncatalysed\nreaction\n∆Hr\nE+S\nEa for the catalysed\nreaction\nFigure 9.12  The energy profile for an enzyme-catalysed \nendothermic reaction, compared with the same reaction \nwithout a catalyst. As for inorganic catalysts, the enzyme \nprovides a different reaction pathway with a lower activation \nenergy (Ea) but the overall enthalpy change (∆Hr) is unaffected.\n\nChapter 9: Rates of reaction\nHowever, enzyme catalysis has some specific features:\n■\n■\nenzymes are more efficient than inorganic catalysts; the \nreaction rate is often increased by a factor of 106 to 1012\n■\n■\nenzymes are very specific; they usually only catalyse one \nparticular reaction\n■\n■\nas a consequence of this specificity, enzymes do not \nproduce byproducts\n■\n■\nenzymes work under very mild conditions; for example \n35 °C, pH 7, atmospheric pressure\n■\n■\nthe amount of enzyme present in a cell can be regulated \naccording to need.\nThe specific substance that fits onto the surface of the \nenzyme molecule and is converted to product(s) is  \ncalled a substrate. For example: the enzyme urease \ncatalyses the reaction:\n(NH2)2CO  +  H2O \n 2NH3  +  CO2\n\t\nurea\nUrea is the substrate in this reaction, because it fits  \nonto the surface of the enzyme molecule.

He left \ngaps where the pattern broke down, arguing that \nthese spaces would eventually be filled by as-yet-\nundiscovered elements. For example, he left a space \nbelow silicon, and he made predictions of how the \n‘new’ element would behave when it was discovered. \nHe also changed the atomic mass order in places \nwhere similar elements did not quite line up in \ncolumns. These apparent inconsistencies resulted in \nsome of his fellow chemists doubting the relevance \nof his table, but they were convinced following \nthe discovery of germanium in 1886. Germanium \nclosely matched the properties that Mendeleev had \npredicted for the ‘new’ element below silicon, using \nhis Periodic Table.\nStructure of the Periodic Table\nWe now know that the chemical elements are arranged in \nthe Periodic Table in order of atomic number, not atomic \nmasses as first thought. This explains why Mendeleev \nhad to re-order some elements in his table (which was \ndeveloped before scientists knew about the structure of the \natom). The modern Periodic Table is shown in Figure 10.2 \non page 150. There are 18 groups (vertical columns) in \nthe Periodic Table. The rows across the table are called \nperiods. In this chapter we will be looking for patterns \ngoing across the third period, from sodium (Na) to argon \n(Ar). The patterns seen across Period 3 are seen across \nother periods, too. This recurrence of the same pattern is \ncalled periodicity.\nQuestion\n1\t Look at the Periodic Table in Figure 10.2.\na\t \u0007Which element is found in Period 4, Group 17?\nb\t \u0007The relative atomic masses of tellurium (Te) and \niodine (I) are 128 and 127, respectively.

The data for these measurements can come \nfrom an element’s single covalent radius (Figure 10.3).\nr\ncovalent radius\nFigure 10.3  The distance between the two nuclei of the same \ntype of atom can be determined and then divided by two to \narrive at the atomic (single covalent) radius.\nThere are other measures of atomic radii, such as metallic \nradii and van der Waals’ radii. However, covalent radii can \nbe obtained for most elements, so these provide the best \ndata for comparison purposes across a period.\nThe values of the atomic radii of the elements in  \nPeriod 3 are given in Table 10.1. We can see the pattern \nacross the period more clearly on a graph (Figure 10.4).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nFigure 10.2  The Periodic Table of the elements.

Their atomic radii can be \ndetermined from their van der Waals’ radius. This is found \nfrom the distance between the nuclei of two neighbouring, \ntouching atoms, which are not chemically bonded \ntogether. This distance is divided by two to give the van \nder Waals’ radius. This figure will be higher than the single \ncovalent radius of any given element, as there is no overlap \nof electron clouds involved in the van der Waals’ radius \n(see Figure 10.3).\nAs shown in Figure 10.4, the atomic radius decreases across \nPeriod 3. The same pattern is also found in other periods. \nAcross a period, the number of protons (and hence the nuclear \n150\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\ncharge), and the number of electrons, increases by one with \neach successive element. The extra electron added to the \natoms of each successive element occupies the same principal \nquantum shell (energy level). This means that the shielding \neffect remains roughly constant (see page 35). So the greater \nattractive force exerted by the increasing positive nuclear \ncharge on the outer (valence) shell electrons pulls them in \ncloser to the nucleus. Hence the atomic radius decreases across \nthe period.\n2 Periodic patterns of ionic radii\nFrom your work in Chapter 4, you will know that the \natoms of metallic elements produce positively charged \nions (called cations), such as Na+. By contrast, the atoms of \nnon-metallic elements form negatively charged ions (called \nanions), such as Cl−. What pattern in ionic radii do we see \ngoing across Period 3? The data are shown in Table 10.2 \nand are displayed graphically in Figure 10.5.\nThe positively charged ions have effectively lost their \nouter shell of electrons (the third principal quantum shell \nor energy level) from their original atoms. Hence the \ncations are much smaller than their atoms. To add to this \neffect, there is also less shielding of the outer electrons in \nthese cations compared with their original atoms.\nGoing across the period, from Na+ to Si4+, the ions \nget smaller for reasons similar to those for the decreasing\n0.30\n0.20\nIonic radius / nm\n0.10\n0\n12\n11\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\nMg2+\nNa+\nAl3+\nSi4+\nP3–\nS2–\nCl–\nAr\nAtomic number\nFigure 10.5  Plotting the ionic radii against atomic number for \nthe elements in Period 3 (argon not included).\nTable 10.2  The ionic radii of Period 3 elements (no data are available for argon).\n\nChapter 10: Periodicity\natomic radii across a period. The increasing nuclear charge \nattracts the outermost (valence-shell) electrons in the \nsecond principal quantum shell (energy level) closer to the \nnucleus with increasing atomic number.\nThe negatively charged ions are larger than their original \natoms. This is because each atom will have gained one or \nmore extra electrons into their third principal quantum shell, \nincreasing the repulsion between its electrons, whereas the \nnuclear charge remains constant. This increases the size of any \nanion compared with its atom.\nThe anions decrease in size, going from P3− to Cl−, as \nthe nuclear charge increases across the period.\nQuestion\n2\t Look at the elements in Period 2 of the Periodic \nTable on page 473. Using your knowledge of Period 3 \nelements, predict and explain the relative sizes of:\na\t \u0007the atomic radii of lithium and fluorine\nb\t \u0007a lithium atom and its ion, Li+\nc\t\n\u0007an oxygen atom and its ion, O2−\nd\t \u0007a nitride ion, N3−, and a fluoride ion, F−.\n151\n3 Periodic patterns of melting points and \nelectrical conductivity\nPhysical properties, such as the melting point and \nelectrical conductivity of the elements, also show trends \nacross a period. Again, using Period 3 as an example, we \ncan show the data in tables and on graphs (see Tables 10.3 \nand 10.4 and the graph in Figure 10.6).\nThe electrical conductivity increases across the metals \nof Period 3 from sodium (Group 1) to aluminium  \n(Group 13). The electrical conductivity then drops \ndramatically to silicon, which is described as a \nsemiconductor, and falls even further to the non-metallic \ninsulators phosphorus and sulfur.\nTo explain the trend in melting points and electrical \nconductivity across a period, we have to consider the \nbonding and structure of the elements (see Table 10.5).\nSodium, magnesium and aluminium, at the start of \nPeriod 3, are all metallic elements. As you saw on page 59,\nIons of Period 3 elements\nNa+\nMg2+\nAl3+\nSi4+\nP3−\nS2−\nCl−\nAr\nIonic radius / nm\n0.095\n0.065\n0.050\n0.041\n0.212\n0.184\n0.181\n–\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\ntheir metallic bonding can be described as positive ions \narranged in a giant lattice held together by a ‘sea’ of \ndelocalised electrons. The delocalised electrons are those \nfrom the outermost (valence) shell. These delocalised \nelectrons are free to move around within the structure \nof the metal. When a potential difference is applied the \ndelocalised electrons drift through the metal towards the \npositive terminal. Both the melting point and the electrical \nconductivity increase from sodium to magnesium to \naluminium. This can be explained by the number of \nelectrons each metal donates into the ‘sea’ of delocalised \nelectrons and the increasing charge on the metal ions in \nthe giant metallic lattice. Each sodium atom donates just \none electron, forming Na+ ions in the lattice, whereas \neach aluminium atom donates three electrons, forming \nAl3+ ions. This makes the metallic bonding in aluminium \nstronger, as the electrostatic forces of attraction between \nits 3+ ions and the larger number of negatively charged \ndelocalised electrons holding the giant structure together \nare stronger. There are also more delocalised electrons \navailable to drift through the structure when aluminium \nmetal conducts an electric current, making aluminium a \nbetter electrical conductor than sodium.\nThe element in the centre of Period 3, silicon, has \nthe highest melting point because of its giant molecular \nstructure (also called a giant covalent structure). Every \nsilicon atom is held to its neighbouring silicon atoms by \nstrong covalent bonds. However, its electrical conductivity \nis much lower than the metals at the start of the period \nbecause there are no delocalised electrons free to move \naround within its structure. Silicon is classed as a \nsemimetal, or metalloid.\nThe elements to the right of silicon are all non-metallic \nelements. They exist as relatively small molecules. Sulfur \nexists as S8 molecules, phosphorus as P4 molecules and \nchlorine as Cl2 molecules. Although the covalent bonds \nwithin each molecule are strong, there are only relatively \nweak van der Waals’ forces between their molecules (see \npage 62). Therefore, it does not take much energy to break \nthese weak intermolecular forces and melt the elements. At \nroom temperature, phosphorus and sulfur are solids with \nlow melting points and chlorine is a gas.\nArgon gas exists as single atoms with very weak van der \nWaals’ forces between these atoms.\n500\n0\n1000\n1500\n12\n11\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\nMg\nNa\nAl\nSi\nP\nS\nCl\nAr\nAtomic number\nMelting point/K\nPeriod 3 element\nsodium (Na) magnesium (Mg) aluminium (Al) silicon (Si) phosphorus (P) sulfur (S) chlorine (Cl) argon (Ar)\nMelting point / K\n371\n923\n932\n1683\n317\n392\n172\n84\nTable 10.3  The melting points of Period 3 elements (measured in kelvin, K, where 0 °C = 273 K).\nPeriod 3 element\nsodium (Na) magnesium (Mg) aluminium (Al) silicon (Si) phosphorus (P) sulfur (S) chlorine (Cl) argon (Ar)\nMelting point / K\n0.218\n0.224\n0.382\n2 × 10−10\n10−17\n10−23\n–\n–\nTable 10.4  The electrical conductivity of Period 3 elements (measured in siemens per metre, S m−1, where siemens are \nproportional to the ease with which electrons can pass through a material).\nPeriod 3 \nelement\nsodium  \n(Na)\nmagnesium \n(Mg)\naluminium \n(Al)\nsilicon  \n(Si)\nphosphorus \n(P)\nsulfur  \n(S)\nchlorine  \n(Cl)\nargon  \n(Ar)\nBonding\nmetallic\nmetallic\nmetallic\ncovalent\ncovalent\ncovalent\ncovalent\n–\nStructure\ngiant  \nmetallic\ngiant  \nmetallic\ngiant  \nmetallic\ngiant \nmolecular\nsimple \nmolecular\nsimple \nmolecular\nsimple \nmolecular\nsimple \nmolecular\nTable 10.5  The bonding and structures of Period 3 elements.\nFigure 10.6  Plotting the melting point against atomic \nnumber for the elements in Period 3.\n152\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nQuestion\n3\t a\t \u0007Why does sulfur have a lower melting point  \nthan silicon?\nb\t \u0007Why does sulfur have a higher melting point  \nthan chlorine?\nc\t\n\u0007Why is magnesium a better electrical conductor \nthan:\n\t\n\t\ni\t\n\u0007phosphorus?\n\t\n\t\nii\t \u0007sodium?\n4 Periodic patterns of first ionisation \nenergies\nYou have looked at the pattern in first ionisation energies \nfor the first two periods on page 41.

When they \nreact, their atoms lose the two electrons from their \noutermost s subshell and form an ion with the stable \nelectronic configuration of a noble gas. This creates a 2+ \nion. For example, in the ionisation of a magnesium atom \nto a magnesium ion:\nMg  \n  Mg2+  +  2e−\noxidation number\t\n0\t\n+2\nThe metals act as reducing agents. Their atoms give away \nelectrons and so they are oxidised themselves as they react \nto form their 2+ ions. The ionisation energies shown in \nTable 11.3 show how easily the two outer electrons are \nremoved from the Group 2 atoms.\nGroup 2 \nelement\nFirst ionisation \nenergy / kJ mol−1\nSecond ionisation \nenergy / kJ mol−1\nberyllium (Be)\n900\n1760\nmagnesium (Mg)\n736\n1450\ncalcium (Ca)\n590\n1150\nstrontium (Sr)\n548\n1060\n165\nbarium (Ba)\n502\n 966\nTable 11.3  The first and second ionisation energies of the \nGroup 2 elements.\nThe metals in Group 2 get more reactive as we go down the \ngroup. As you can see from Table 11.3, it takes less energy \n(i.e. it gets easier) to remove the pair of outer electrons \ngoing down Group 2. So, although the positive charge \non the nucleus increases down the group, the greater \nshielding effect provided by extra inner shells of electrons \nand the larger distance of the outermost electrons from \nthe nucleus outweigh the attraction of the higher nuclear \ncharge. This helps to explain the increase in reactivity \ngoing down the group, as it gets easier for the atoms to \nform their 2+ ions.\nThe Group 2 metals get more reactive going down the \ngroup.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nReaction with oxygen\nThe Group 2 metals burn in air, and more rapidly in \noxygen, forming white solid oxides. For example, \nmagnesium ribbon burns with a bright white flame \nonce ignited in a Bunsen flame (Figure 11.5):\n2Mg(s)  +  O2(g)  \n  2MgO(s)\nFigure 11.5  Magnesium ribbon reacting with oxygen  \nin the air.\n166\nThe magnesium oxide formed is basic in character, as \nshown on page 156. Calcium oxide, CaO, reacts with \nwater to form calcium hydroxide. If water is dripped \nonto the surface of a lump of calcium oxide it causes \na vigorous reaction. It gives off so much heat that \nsome of the water boils off as the solid lump appears \nto expand and cracks open:\nCaO(s)  +  H2O(l)  \n  Ca(OH)2(s)\nReaction with water\nWe have seen on page 155 how magnesium reacts \nvery slowly with cold water but will eventually form a \nweakly alkaline solution:\nMg(s)  +  2H2O(l)  \n  Mg(OH)2(aq)  +  H2(g)\n\nIn excess water, some of the slightly soluble calcium \nhydroxide dissolves to form a weakly alkaline \nsolution. The excess aqueous hydroxide ions in the \nsolution result in its pH of 11:\nwater\nCa(OH)2(s)  \n  Ca2+(aq)  +  2OH−(aq)\nIn general, the reaction and dissolving of the Group 2 \nmetal oxides in water is described by the following \nionic equation:\nO2−(s)  +  H2O(l)  \n  2OH−(aq)\nThe Group 2 metals get more reactive with oxygen \ngoing down the group. The larger atoms lose their \nouter two electrons more readily than the smaller \natoms in the group. The reasons for this are given \nbeneath Table 11.3.\nThe greater reactivity of barium metal is illustrated \nby the fact that it must be stored under oil to keep it \nout of contact with air.\nSome of the Group 2 metals burn with characteristic \nflame colours. It is the 2+ ions formed in the  \nreaction that cause the colours. We can test for \ncalcium, strontium and barium in compounds \nusing flame tests. A nichrome wire, cleaned with \nconcentrated hydrochloric acid, is dipped into a \nsample of the salt to be tested and heated in a non-\nluminous Bunsen flame:\n■\n■\ncalcium compounds give a brick-red colour\n■\n■\nstrontium compounds give a scarlet/red colour\n■\n■\nbarium compounds give an apple-green colour.\nHot magnesium does react vigorously with water in \nthe form of steam to make magnesium oxide and \nhydrogen gas (Figure 11.6):\nMg(s)  +  H2O(g)  \n  MgO(s)  +  H2(g)\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nReaction with water (continued)\nCalcium reacts more readily than magnesium with \nwater:\nCa(s)  +  2H2O(l)  \n  Ca(OH)2(aq)  +  H2(g)\nThis reaction forms a cloudy white suspension of \nslightly soluble calcium hydroxide. The calcium \nhydroxide that does dissolve makes the solution \nweakly alkaline. The hydrogen gas is given off at a \nsteady rate. Going down the group, hydrogen gas is \nreleased more and more rapidly by the reaction of \nthe element with water (Figure 11.7).\nThe resulting solutions also get more alkaline going down the \ngroup. We can explain this by looking at the solubility of \nthe hydroxides formed (see Table 11.4). Their solubility \nincreases on going down Group 2. Therefore when adding \nand stirring magnesium hydroxide in water to make a \nsaturated solution, then doing the same with barium \nhydroxide and water, there will be a higher concentration \nof hydroxide ions in the case of the saturated barium \nhydroxide solution. This results in a higher pH value for \nthe barium hydroxide solution.\nGroup 2 element\nSolubility of hydroxide at 298 K / mol / 100 g of water\nmagnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2\n2.0 × 10−5\ncalcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2\n1.5 × 10−3\nstrontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2\n3.4 × 10−3\nbarium hydroxide, Ba(OH)2\n1.5 × 10−2\nTable 11.4  Solubility of the Group 2 hydroxides in water.\n\nChapter 11: Group 2\nFigure 11.6  An experiment showing magnesium reacting with steam.

For example, their sulfates become \nless soluble – so barium sulfate is much less soluble \nthan magnesium sulfate. (In fact the test for sulfate ions \ndepends on the formation of a white precipitate of barium \nsulfate, produced when barium chloride solution is added \nto a solution of the compound being tested.)\nYou can read more about the reasons why the  \nGroup 2 sulfates get less soluble going down the group on \npage 267.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n2\t a\t \u0007Write a balanced chemical equation, including \nstate symbols, for the reaction of:\ni\t\n\u0007strontium with oxygen\nii\t \u0007strontium oxide with water.\nb\t i\t\n\u0007Write a balanced chemical equation, including \nstate symbols, for the reaction of barium  \nwith water.\nii\t \u0007Predict the pH of the solution formed in  \npart b i.\nc\t\n\u0007Radium (Ra) is a radioactive element found below \nbarium at the bottom of Group 2.

However, they all react \nin dilute acid, forming a salt and water and giving off \ncarbon dioxide gas. For example, with dilute sulfuric acid:\nMgCO3(s)  +  H2SO4(aq)  \n  MgSO4(aq)  +  H2O(l)  \n+  CO2(g)\nThe magnesium sulfate salt formed in the reaction above \nis soluble in water so remains in aqueous solution, and no \nsolid will remain in excess dilute sulfuric acid. However, \nthe sulfates of the other Group 2 elements tend to form an \ninsoluble sulfate layer on the carbonate, preventing further \nreaction after the initial effervescence of carbon dioxide \ngas is seen.\nWith dilute nitric acid, all the nitrate salts formed are \nsoluble in water. For example:\nCaCO3(s)  +  2HNO3(aq)\nCa(NO3)2(aq)  +  H2O(l)  +  CO2(g)\n\nThe reactions with dilute hydrochloric acid also form \nsoluble salts, the chlorides. For example:\nBaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq)  \n  BaCl2(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)\nThermal decomposition of \nGroup 2 carbonates and nitrates\nThe carbonates and nitrates of the Group 2 elements \ndecompose when heated. The carbonates break down to \nform the metal oxide and give off carbon dioxide gas.  \nFor example:\nheat\nMgCO3(s)  \n  MgO(s)  +  CO2(g)\nThe temperature at which thermal decomposition takes \nplace increases going down Group 2.\nThe Group 2 nitrates also undergo thermal \ndecomposition. For example:\nheat\n2Ca(NO3)2(s)  \n  2CaO(s)  +  4NO2(g)  +  O2(g)\nA brown gas is observed when a Group 2 nitrate is heated. This \nis toxic nitrogen dioxide, NO2 (nitrogen(IV) oxide).\nAs with the carbonates, a higher temperature is needed \nto thermally decompose the nitrates as Group 2  \nis descended.\nYou can read an explanation of the trend in the  \nthermal stability of the Group 2 carbonates and nitrates  \non page 264.\nQuestion\n3\t a\t \u0007Write a balanced symbol equation for the reaction \nof barium carbonate with dilute nitric acid.\nb\t \u0007Which one of the three compounds listed will \ndecompose at the lowest temperature?\ni\t\n\u0007calcium carbonate, strontium carbonate, \nbarium carbonate\nii\t \u0007barium nitrate, calcium nitrate, magnesium \nnitrate\nc\t\n\u0007Write a balanced chemical equation, including \nstate symbols, for the thermal decomposition of:\ni\t\n\u0007strontium carbonate\nii\t \u0007barium nitrate.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nSome uses of Group 2 \ncompounds\nWe have just seen how the Group 2 carbonates decompose \non heating. Limestone is made up mainly of calcium \ncarbonate. There are many types of limestone, which \nprovide useful rocks for building. They can be shaped \ninto blocks that can be stuck to each other using mortar. \nPreviously this mortar was made using lime and sand. \nNow it is more usual to use cement and sand, although the \ncement is made from lime – see below. Marble is another \nform of calcium carbonate used as a building material, for \nexample to make expensive tiles.\nHowever, most calcium carbonate is used to make \ncement. The first stage in the manufacture of cement is the \nroasting of limestone in a lime kiln (Figure 11.8).  \nAt the high temperatures in the kiln, calcium carbonate \ndecomposes to form calcium oxide (also called lime  \nor quicklime):\nheat\nCaCO3(s)  \n  CaO(s)  +  CO2(g)\n\t\n\t\nlime\nThe calcium oxide made in the lime kiln goes on to be \nroasted with clay to make cement. Cement can be mixed \nwith sand and small pieces of rock to make concrete, the \nmost widely used building material in the world. Its tensile \nstrength can be improved by letting the concrete set with \niron rods running through it.\nSlaked lime (calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2) is also \nused by farmers to raise the pH of acidic soil. Calcium \nhydroxide is basic, so it will react with and neutralise acid, \nraising the pH of the soil.\n\nChapter 11: Group 2\n169\nFigure 11.8  In a rotating lime kiln, calcium carbonate \nundergoes thermal decomposition to form calcium oxide and \ncarbon dioxide.\nQuestion\n4\t a\t \u0007How is limestone turned into lime in industry?\nb\t \u0007Which major construction materials are made \nfrom cement?\nc\t\n\u0007Both calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide \nhave giant ionic structures.

The next element in Group \n17 is chlorine, also a toxic gas, but its compounds, \nsuch as trichlorophenol, are important disinfectants. \nCompounds of carbon, fluorine and chlorine are \nknown as CFCs and have been responsible for most of \nthe damage to the Earth’s ozone layer. You can read \nmore about uses of the halogens and their compounds \non page 178.\nPhysical properties of Group 17 \nelements\nIn this chapter we will look at the elements in Group 17 \nof the Periodic Table, called the halogens. Their atoms all \nhave seven electrons in the outer principal quantum shell. \nHere are the electronic configurations of the first four \nelements in Group 17:\n172\nFluorine (F)\t\n1s22s22p5\nChlorine (Cl)\t\n1s22s22p63s23p5\nBromine (Br)\t\n1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p5\nIodine (I)\t\n1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p64d105s25p5\nThe Group 17 elements are all non-metals. At room \ntemperature, they exist as diatomic molecules, i.e. \nmolecules made up of two atoms, F2, Cl2, Br2 and I2 \n(Figure 12.2). There is a single covalent bond between the \ntwo atoms in each molecule. Table 12.1 shows some of \ntheir physical properties.\nFigure 12.2  Three of the Group 17 elements, known as  \nthe halogens.\n\nFigure 12.1  Chlorine may be added to drinking water to kill \nharmful microorganisms.\nGroup 17 \nelement\nAtomic \nradius / \nnm\nMelting \npoint / °C\nBoiling \npoint / °C\nColour\nfluorine (F2)\n0.072\n−220\n−188\npale yellow\nchlorine \n(Cl2)\n0.099\n−101\n−35\ngreen/yellow\nbromine \n(Br2)\n0.114\n−7\n 59\norange/\nbrown\niodine (I2)\n0.133\n114\n184\ngrey/black \nsolid, purple \nvapour\nTable 12.1  Some physical properties of the Group 17 \nelements. The atomic radius value is taken from single \ncovalent data (see page 51).\nThe melting points and boiling points of the halogens \nincrease going down the group. The boiling point data \ngives us an idea of the volatility of the halogens, i.e. the \nease with which they evaporate. All the values are relatively \nlow because they have simple molecular structures. \nThere are only weak van der Waals’ forces between their \ndiatomic molecules. These forces increase as the number \nof electrons in the molecules increases with increasing \natomic number. The greater the number of electrons, the \ngreater the opportunities for instantaneous dipoles arising \nwithin molecules, and for induced dipoles to be produced \non neighbouring molecules. So the larger the molecules, \nthe stronger the van der Waals’ forces between molecules, \nmaking iodine the least volatile and fluorine the most \nvolatile of the halogens we are considering.\nThe colours of the halogens get darker going down  \nthe group.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nQuestion\n1\t a\t \u0007What trend in volatility is seen going down  \nGroup 17?\nb\t \u0007Using Table 12.1, what is the state of each halogen \nat 20 °C?\nc\t\n\u0007What is the trend in the atomic radii of the \nhalogens?

Therefore \nthey react with metallic elements, with each of their atoms \ngaining an electron from a metal atom to become ions \nwith a 1− charge. For example:\nCa(s)  +  Cl2(g)  \n  Ca2+Cl−\n2(s)\nWhen a halogen reacts with a metal atom, the halogen \natom gains one electron. Because of this, the halogens are \noxidising agents (electron acceptors). In the process of \noxidising another substance they themselves are reduced. \nTheir oxidation number is reduced from 0 in the element \nusually to −1 in the compound formed.\nCl2  \n  2Cl−  +  2e−\noxidation number\t\n0\t\n−1\nThe halogens also react with many non-metals, each \nhalogen atom sharing a pair of electrons with the other \nnon-metal atom in a covalent bond, e.g. in hydrogen \nchloride, HCl.\nH2(g)  +  Cl2(g)  \n  2HCl(g)\n\nChapter 12: Group 17\nThe reactions of chlorine with calcium and with hydrogen \nshown here can be repeated with the other halogens. In \nthese experiments we find that the reactions of fluorine \nare more vigorous than those of chlorine. Bromine reacts \nless vigorously than chlorine, and iodine is less reactive \nthan bromine.\nThe halogens get less reactive going down Group 17.\nThis pattern in reactivity corresponds to the trend \nin electronegativity going down the group, shown in \nTable 12.2.\nHalogen\nElectronegativity\nfluorine (F)\n4.0\nchlorine (Cl)\n3.0\nbromine (Br)\n2.8\n173\niodine (I)\n2.5\nTable 12.2  Electronegativity values of the halogens.\nA fluorine atom has the strongest pull on the pair of \nelectrons in a covalent bond, while an iodine atom has \nthe weakest attraction for electrons. We can explain this \nby looking at the atomic radii data in Table 12.1. The \nfluorine atom is the smallest in the group. Its outer shell \nis nearer to the attractive force of the nucleus and an \nelectron entering its outer shell will also experience the \nleast shielding from the attraction of the positive nuclear \ncharge. These factors outweigh the fact that fluorine’s \nnuclear charge is only 9+ compared with iodine’s 53+. \nTherefore fluorine is a much stronger oxidising agent \n(acceptor of electrons) than iodine.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nReactions with hydrogen\nThe halogens form hydrogen halides with hydrogen \ngas. One example of this is the reaction of hydrogen \nwith chlorine to give hydrogen chloride (see page 173). \nThe trend in reactivity is illustrated by their reactions \n(Table 12.3).\nWe can also judge the reactivity (or the oxidising \npower) of the halogens by looking at their displacement \nreactions with other halide ions in solution.\nA more reactive halogen can displace a less  \nreactive halogen from a halide solution of the less \nreactive halogen.\nLet’s look at an example. When chlorine water, Cl2(aq), \nis added to a solution of sodium bromide, containing \nBr−(aq) ions, the solution changes to a yellowish \nbrown colour. The colour is caused by the presence \nof dissolved bromine molecules, Br2(aq), as found in \nbromine water. The displacement reaction that takes \nplace is:\nCl2(aq)  +  2NaBr(aq)  \n  2NaCl(aq)  +  Br2(aq)\nWe say that chlorine has displaced bromine  \nfrom solution.\nThis is summarised in the ionic equation for this \ndisplacement reaction:\nCl2(aq)  +  2Br−(aq)  \n  2Cl−(aq)  +  Br2(aq)\nthe chlorine atoms are more electronegative than \nbromine atoms so have a stronger tendency to form \nnegatively charged ions.\nLikewise, bromine will displace iodine from an  \niodide solution:\nBr2(aq)  +  2NaI(aq)  \n  2NaBr(aq)  +  I2(aq)\nor as an ionic equation:\nBr2(aq)  +  2I−(aq)  \n  2Br−(aq)  +  I2(aq)\nDisplacement reactions\nThe colours of the halogen molecules in solution \nare difficult to identify positively in these \ndisplacement reactions. However, the halogens \ndissolve well in cyclohexane (which is immiscible in \nwater, forming two separate layers). The halogens \ndissolved in cyclohexane are distinctly different \ncolours. Therefore adding some of this organic \nsolvent after mixing the halogen/halide solutions, \nshaking the mixture and then allowing it to settle \ninto layers shows clearly which halogen is present \nas its diatomic molecules (Figure 12.3).\nFigure 12.3  Cyclohexane forms a layer on top of water. \nDissolved iodine is purple in this upper organic layer, \nbromine is orange and chlorine is very pale green.\n2\t Chlorine water is mixed with a solution of potassium \niodide in a test tube. 2 cm3 of cyclohexane is added \nto the test tube, which is stoppered and shaken, then \nallowed to stand.\n\t\na\t \u0007Write a balanced symbol equation, including state \nsymbols, for the reaction that occurs.\n\t\nb\t \u0007Write an ionic equation for this reaction.\n\t\nc\t\n\u0007What colour is the cyclohexane layer at the end of \nthe experiment?\nQuestion\n174\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nEquation for reaction\nDescription of reaction\nH2(g)  +  F2(g)  \n  2HF(g)\nreacts explosively even in cool, \ndark conditions\nH2(g)  +  Cl2(g)  \n  2HCl(g)\nreacts explosively in sunlight\nH2(g)  +  Br2(g)  \n  2HBr(g) reacts slowly on heating\nH2(g)  +  I2(g)  \n  2HI(g)\nforms an equilibrium mixture on \nheating\nTable 12.3  The reactions of hydrogen and the halogens, \nshowing decreasing reactivity going down Group 17.\nThe hydrogen halides formed differ in their thermal \nstability.

This is because the iodine atom \nis the largest atom, so the overlap of its outer shell with a \nhydrogen atom gives a much longer bond length than with \nthe other smaller halogen atoms.

Nitrogen is  \na vital element in many of the processes of life, but  \nas a pure gas it is unreactive. For this reason, \nnitrogen gas helps to prevent explosions when  \ncrude oil is pumped into or out of super-tankers,\na\nb\nNitrogen gas\nNitrogen is in Group 15 of the Periodic Table. It is a non-\nmetallic element that makes up about 78% of the Earth’s \natmosphere. It exists as diatomic molecules, N2. Nitrogen \ngas is the unreactive gas in air that dilutes the effects of  \nthe reactive gas, oxygen. To understand the lack of \nreactivity of nitrogen gas, we have to look at the bonding \nwithin its molecules.\nThe electronic configuration of a nitrogen atom is \n1s22s22p3. Its atoms need to gain three electrons to achieve \nthe noble gas configuration of neon. Nitrogen atoms do \nthis by forming a triple covalent bond between two atoms \n(see Figure 13.2).\n\nChapter 13: Nitrogen and sulfur\nwhen the volatile fuel vapours can mix with oxygen \nfrom the air.\nSulfur is a Group 16 element that is mined for \nthe production of sulfuric(VI) acid, one of the \nmost important industrial chemicals, used in the \nmanufacture of paints, dyes, plastics and fibres.\n181\nFigure 13.1  a Nitrogen gas is used in the hold of oil tankers above the crude oil as it is pumped ashore. This unreactive gas helps \nto prevent the chance of an explosive mixture of crude oil vapour and air forming inside the tanker. b Sulfur can be mined from \nunderground deposits by pumping down super-heated water to melt the sulfur (it melts at about 115 °C). The molten sulfur is then \nforced to the surface under pressure and allowed to solidify back into a brittle, yellow solid. The ‘crown-shaped’ sulfur molecules, \nS8, can pack together in regular patterns, forming crystals.\nN\n+\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\ntwo nitrogen atoms (2,5)\nnitrogen molecule\n–each is now (2,8)\nFigure 13.2  The bonding in a nitrogen molecule, N2.\nThe triple covalent bond is very strong; its bond energy is \nalmost 1000 kJ mol−1.

When crops \nare harvested by farmers the nitrogen is not replaced, \nas the plants do not die naturally and rot back into the \nsoil. So farmers use ammonium compounds to replace \nthis nitrogen in the soil. Common ammonium salts \nused in fertilisers include ammonium chloride, NH4Cl, \nammonium nitrate, NH4NO3, ammonium phosphate, \n(NH4)3PO4, and ammonium sulfate, (NH4)2SO4.\nIf we heat an ammonium salt with a base, the \nammonium ion produces ammonia gas. We use this \nreaction to prepare ammonia gas in the laboratory. \nAmmonium chloride and calcium hydroxide, both in \nthe solid state, are usually mixed then heated (see the \napparatus in Figure 13.5).\nheat\n2NH4Cl(s) + Ca(OH)2(s) \n CaCl2(s) + 2H2O(l) + 2NH3(g)\nammonia\ngas\nammonium\nchloride and\ncalcium\nhydroxide\ndamp red\nlitmus paper\nturns blue\ncalcium oxide\nto dry the\nammonia\nheat\nFigure 13.5  Preparing ammonia gas from an ammonium \nsalt, NH4Cl, and a base, Ca(OH)2.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nThis reaction is used as the basis of the test for \nammonium ions.

About 85% of the millions \nof tonnes of ammonia produced each year in the Haber \nprocess are used to make fertilisers. A relatively small \namount of ammonia itself is used as fertiliser, mainly in \nthe USA. This is injected into the soil. However, the vast \nmajority of ammonia is reacted with acids to make solid \nammonium salts.\nThe major nitrogen-based fertiliser is ammonium \nnitrate, NH4NO3. This is manufactured from ammonia \nand nitric acid:\nNH3(aq)  +  HNO3(aq)  \n  NH4NO3(aq)\nThe ammonium nitrate solution is heated to evaporate \noff the water and melt the solid. The molten solid is \nthen sprayed into a tower with air blown into it. This \nsolidifies the ammonium nitrate into pellets, which \nmakes it convenient for farmers to spread from tractors \n(Figure 13.6). Ammonium sulfate, (NH4)2SO4, and \nammonium phosphate, (NH4)3PO4, are other ammonium \nsalts used in fertilisers.\nThe nitric acid used to make ammonium nitrate is \nitself made from ammonia in another chemical process. \nFertiliser factories making ammonium nitrate often have \nthree plants side by side, making:\n■\n■\nammonia in the Haber process\n■\n■\nnitric acid from ammonia\n■\n■\nammonium nitrate from nitric acid and ammonia.\n\nChapter 13: Nitrogen and sulfur\nFigure 13.6  Ammonium nitrate is spread as pellets onto \nthe soil.\nConcentrated nitric acid has other important uses. \nIt is used to make many types of explosive, such as \ntrinitrotoluene (TNT). About 10% of ammonium nitrate \nis used to make explosives.

This has created an environmental \nproblem. The nitrates can be washed, or leached, out of the \nsoil by rain into groundwater. These can then find their \nway into rivers and lakes. Once in the rivers and lakes, the \nnitrates promote the growth of the water plants, which can \n‘strangle’ a river. But the biggest problem is the growth \nof algae (a simple water plant) on the surface, causing \neutrophication (Figure 13.7).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nFigure 13.7  Fertilisers leached from farmland have caused \neutrophication in this river.\n■\n■\nA bloom of algae can spread across the surface, blocking \nout the light for other plant life in the water.\n■\n■\nWhen the plants and algae die, bacteria in the water feed on \nthem, decomposing the plant material.\n■\n■\nThe bacteria multiply rapidly with so much food available, \nusing up the dissolved oxygen in the water.\n■\n■\nFish extract dissolved oxygen from water, taken in through \ntheir gills. Without this dissolved oxygen they die, affecting \nthe whole ecosystem.\n184\nThis isn’t the only problem with fertilisers being leached \nfrom the soil. Nitrates have also been detected in our \ndrinking water, especially in agricultural areas. People are \nworried that nitrates in drinking water cause ‘blue baby’ \nsyndrome (when a newborn baby’s blood is starved of \noxygen), as well as stomach cancer. But others argue that \nlinks between nitrates and diseases have not been proven and \nthat recommended nitrate levels are set unrealistically low.\nFarmers can help limit the amount of nitrates in \nwater courses by adding the most economical amounts \nof fertilisers at the right time of year. This will minimise \nthe leaching of excess fertiliser from the soil and into our \nrivers and lakes.\nNitrogen oxides in the atmosphere\nAt the start of this chapter we saw how unreactive \nnitrogen gas is. However, in the extreme conditions in  \na thunderstorm, lightning can trigger the reaction \nbetween nitrogen and oxygen to form gaseous nitrogen \noxides – nitrogen(II) oxide, NO and nitrogen(IV) oxide, \nNO2. A similar oxidation of nitrogen takes place inside \na car engine. In the engine’s cylinders a mixture of air\n\n(mainly nitrogen plus oxygen) and fuel is compressed  \nand ignited by a spark. Under these conditions (high \npressure and high temperature) nitrogen forms nitrogen \noxides. These are released into the atmosphere in the car’s \nexhaust fumes.\nNitrogen oxides are pollutants. They cause acid rain \nand photochemical smog. Nitrogen oxides also catalyse \nthe oxidation of sulfur dioxide gas, SO2, in the atmosphere \nduring the formation of acid rain. The sulfur trioxide, SO3, \ngas that is produced by this oxidation reacts with rainwater, \nforming sulfuric acid. The reactions below show the \ncatalytic activity of the nitrogen oxides:\nSO2(g)  +  NO2(g)  \n  SO3(g)  +  NO(g)\nThen NO2 is regenerated as NO reacts with oxygen in  \nthe air:\nNO(g)  +  ​ 1 _ \n2 ​ O2(g)  \n  NO2(g)\nThis NO2 molecule can then go on to oxidise another \nsulfur dioxide molecule, at the same time producing an NO \nmolecule to make another NO2 molecule. this will oxidise \nanother sulfur dioxide molecule, and so on. Therefore NO2 \ncatalyses the oxidation of SO2.\nNowadays, car exhaust systems are fitted with catalytic \nconverters to help reduce the pollutants from motor \nvehicles (see page 205). The reaction on the surface of the \nhot catalyst (e.g. platinum) reduces the nitrogen oxides to \nharmless nitrogen gas, which is released from the vehicle’s \nexhaust pipe.\n2CO(g)  +  2NO(g)  \n  2CO2(g)  +  N2(g)\nQuestion\n3\t a\t \u0007Why is ammonia so important in providing enough \nfood to feed the world?\nb\t \u0007Give one environmental problem and one possible \nhealth problem associated with nitrate fertilisers.\nc\t\n\u0007Explain how nitrogen oxides are involved in the \nformation of atmospheric sulfur trioxide (SO3).\nd\t \u0007The following reaction takes place in a car’s \ncatalytic converter once it is warmed up:\n2CO(g)  +  2NO(g)  \n  2CO2(g)  +  N2(g)\n\u0007Use oxidation numbers to explain which species is \nreduced and which is oxidised in the reaction.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nSulfur and its oxides\nWe have just seen how sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere \ncan be oxidised by nitrogen(IV) oxide to form sulfur(VI) \noxide (also known as sulfur trioxide). This reacts with \nwater to form sulfuric acid, which is the main cause of \nacid rain.\nSO3(g)  +  H2O(l)  \n  H2SO4(aq)\nThe sulfur dioxide is formed when we burn fossil fuels, \nespecially coal. Crude oil, natural gas and coal have sulfur \ncompounds present in them as impurities. When the \nfossil fuels (or fuels extracted from them, such as petrol \nor diesel) are burnt, the sulfur impurities get oxidised \nto sulfur dioxide. There are also large volumes of sulfur \ndioxide released naturally from volcanic activity.\nAcid rain has harmful effects on:\n■\n■\nplants (especially trees)\n■\n■\nrivers, streams and lakes (and the fish and other animals in \nthese habitats)\n■\n■\nbuildings, statues (Figure 13.8) and metal structures.\nFigure 13.8  This limestone carving has been chemically \nweathered by acid rain.\nThe acid rain leaches (washes out) nutrients from the soil, \nand so prevents the healthy growth of plants. Not only \nthat, the acid rain can attack the waxy layer on leaves. This \nincreases water loss and makes the plant more susceptible \nto disease and pests. Trees that grow at high altitudes are \nespecially vulnerable, as they are often in contact with the \ntiny droplets of water (sulfuric acid solution) in clouds.\n\nChapter 13: Nitrogen and sulfur\nAcid rain falling into streams, rivers and lakes will \nlower the pH of the water. Many aquatic animals are very \nsensitive to changes in pH. Many insect larvae cannot \nsurvive even slight increases in acidity. Other animals \nhigher up the food chain may be more resistant, but their \nnumbers will decrease as their food source dies off.\nIn our cities, the acid rain attacks buildings and \nstatues, especially those made from carbonate rock. The \nmost common of these is limestone, containing calcium \ncarbonate. The main metal used in construction, iron in \nthe form of steel, is also corroded by acid rain.\nChemists have found ways to reduce sulfur dioxide \nemissions from fossil fuels. They now produce ‘low-sulfur’ \nversions of petrol and diesel. In power stations that burn \nfossil fuels, the sulfur is removed from the fuel before \nburning.

The raw materials needed \nare sulfur, air and water. Sulfur can be mined from \nunderground (see Figure 13.1b at the start of this chapter). \nPoland and the USA export sulfur around the world. The \nsulfur extracted from the impurities in fossil fuels can also \nbe used in the Contact process.\nLike nitric acid, sulfuric acid is used to manufacture \nfertilisers, detergents, paints, pigments, dyes and synthetic \nfibres.

All these \nmolecules are based on carbon compounds. The \ncomplexity of life requires a great variety of different \ncompounds. The great variety of organic compounds \nis possible because every carbon atom can bond \nwith other carbon atoms to form chains and rings. \nThese chains and rings are often found bonded to \natoms of other elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen \nand nitrogen. This explains the millions of organic \ncompounds that exist.\nNote that not all carbon compounds are classified \nas organic compounds. The oxides of carbon \nand compounds containing carbonate and \nhydrogencarbonate ions are classed as  \ninorganic compounds.\nRepresenting organic molecules\nFigure 14.2 shows two types of three-dimensional \n(3D) diagram representing a selection of organic \nmolecules.

It tells us  \nthe simplest ratio of the different types of atoms present in the \nmolecule. For example, an organic compound called propene \nhas the empirical formula CH2. This tells us that it has twice \nas many hydrogen atoms as carbon atoms in its molecules. \nWe can calculate empirical formulae from experimental data \non the mass of each element, and hence the number of moles \nof each element, in a sample of a compound.\nThe molecular formula shows us the actual numbers \nof each type of atom in a molecule. To find this we need to \nknow the relative molecular mass of the compound. The \nrelative molecular mass of propene is 42. We know that its \nempirical formula is CH2; this CH2 group of atoms has a \nrelative mass of 14, as the relative atomic mass of C = 12 \nand H = 1. By dividing the relative molecular mass by the \nrelative mass of the empirical formula (42/14 = 3), we see \nthat there must be (3 × CH2) atoms in a propene molecule. \nSo its molecular formula is C3H6.\nChemists can give more detail about a molecule by \ngiving its structural formula. This tells us about the atoms \nbonded to each carbon atom in the molecule. The structural \nformula of propene is CH3HC   CH2 (also written as \nCH3CH   CH2 – but the central H atom does not form a \ndouble bond!). This tells us how many hydrogen atoms are \nbonded to each carbon atom, and that two of the carbon \natoms in the molecule are joined by a double bond.  \nCarbon–carbon double bonds are shown in a structural \nformula. However, all the bonds within a molecule are \nshown in its displayed formula. We can think of this\n190\n\nrepresentation as a 2D, or flattened, version of the ‘ball-\nand-stick’ models shown in Figure 14.2.

Within a class of \ncompounds all the compounds consist of molecules \nwith a particular atom, or grouping of atoms, called \na functional group. Different classes of compounds \nhave different functional groups. The functional group \ndetermines the characteristic chemical properties of the \ncompounds that contain that specific functional group. \nThe functional group in an alkene is the C   C double \nbond. The functional group in a carboxylic acid is the\nCOOH group.\nThe general formula of the class of compounds is given \nin Table 14.2. By substituting a number for n in the general \nformula you get the molecular formula of a particular \ncompound containing that functional group. Note that \nthis formula assumes there is just one functional group \npresent in the molecule.\nNaming organic compounds\nChemists have a system of naming organic compounds \nthat can be applied consistently. This means that they can \ncommunicate with each other clearly when referring to \norganic compounds.\nThe class of hydrocarbons called alkanes provide \nthe basis of the naming system. The stem of each name \nindicates how many carbon atoms are in the longest \nchain in one molecule of the compound. Table 14.3 shows \nthe names of the first ten alkanes and the stems used in \nnaming other molecules.\n192\nNumber \nof carbon \natoms\nMolecular formula \nof straight-chain \nalkane\nName of \nalkane\nStem used \nin naming\n1\nCH4\nmethane\nmeth-\n2\nC2H6\nethane\neth-\n3\nC3H8\npropane\nprop-\n4\nC4H10\nbutane\nbut-\n5\nC5H12\npentane\npent-\n6\nC6H14\nhexane\nhex-\n7\nC7H16\nheptane\nhept-\n8\nC8H18\noctane\noct-\n9\nC9H20\nnonane\nnon-\n10\nC10H22\ndecane\ndec-\nTable 14.3  The stems used in naming simple organic \ncompounds that contain a hydrocarbon chain.\n\nThe position of side-chains or functional groups is \nindicated by numbering the carbon atoms in the longest \nchain.

If there is more \nthan one of the same alkyl side-chain or functional group \nwe indicate how many by inserting di (for two), tri (for \nthree) or tetra (for four) in front of its name.

For some functional \ngroups no number is needed because the group can \nonly be positioned at the end of a chain. Examples of \nthis include carboxylic acids, such as butanoic acid, and \naldehydes, such as pentanal.\nAs well as alkyl groups, you also have to recognise aryl \ngroups.

This means that carbon has \nfour electrons in its outermost shell. By forming single \ncovalent bonds with four other atoms, a carbon atom can \ngain the electronic configuration of the noble gas neon \n(see page 49). These single covalent bonds are known as \nsigma (σ) bonds.\nThe pair of electrons in a σ bond is found in a region of \nspace (described as a lobe) between the nuclei of the two \natoms sharing the electrons. The electrostatic attraction \nbetween the negatively charged electrons and the two \npositively charged nuclei bonds the atoms to each other \n(see page 51).\nIn many organic compounds each carbon atom \nforms four σ bonds. The four bonding pairs of electrons \naround each carbon atom repel each other. They position \nthemselves in a tetrahedral arrangement to get as far apart \nfrom each other as possible. The tetrahedral bond angle \nis 109.5° (see page 55).

These two stereoisomers \nhave different arrangements of the atoms in space so they \nare different compounds with different physical properties \nand some different chemical properties, e.g. differing rates \nfor the same reaction.

It can be thought of as \nfluctuating electric and magnetic fields, vibrating at right \nangles to each other in every possible direction. Passing \nthis unpolarised light through a polariser results in \npolarised light, which vibrates in only one plane.

Like all chemical reactions, \norganic reactions involve the breaking and making of \nchemical bonds. There are two ways in which covalent \nbonds can break:\n■\n■\nhomolytic fission\n■\n■\nheterolytic fission.\nHomolytic fission\nIn this type of bond breaking, both the atoms at each end \nof the bond leave with one electron from the pair that \nformed the covalent bond. This is shown in Figure 14.22, \nusing the simple example of a hydrogen chloride molecule.\nH\nCl\nH\n+\nCl\n⎯→\nFigure 14.22  Homolytic fission of a covalent bond.\n\nThe species produced when a bond breaks homolytically \nare called free radicals. We can show the formation of free \nradicals by using an equation:\nHCl   \n   H   +  Cl\nH  and Cl  are free radicals. All free radicals have an \nunpaired electron (represented by the dot) and are  \nvery reactive.\nYou can read more about a free-radical reaction on \npage 207.\n■\n■\nThis type of reaction involves the formation of the free \nradicals in an initiation step. This requires an input  \nof energy to break a covalent bond, resulting in two  \nfree radicals.\n■\n■\nThe radicals formed can then attack reactant molecules, \ngenerating more free radicals. These reactions are called \npropagation steps. They can be thought of as a chain \nreaction, which only stops when free radicals react with \neach other.\n■\n■\nTwo free radicals reacting together will form a molecule, \nwith no free radicals generated. Therefore this is called a \ntermination step.\nHeterolytic fission\nThe second type of bond breaking involves the ‘uneven’ \nbreaking of a covalent bond. In heterolytic fission the \nmore electronegative atom takes both the electrons in the \ncovalent bond. Again we can use hydrogen chloride to \nillustrate this (Figure 14.23).\n+\n–\n⎯→\nCl\nH\nH\n+\nCl\nFigure 14.23  Heterolytic fission of a covalent bond.\nWe can show this type of bond breaking in an equation.  \nA small curly arrow shows the movement of a pair  \nof electrons:\nH \n  Cl    \n     H+  +  Cl−\nThe heterolytic fission of a bond can involve a C \n X bond, \nwhere X is an atom more electronegative than carbon.  \nFor example:\nH3C \n  Br    \n     CH3\n+  +  Br−\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nIn this case, as the bond breaks, the Br atom takes \nboth the shared electrons, forming a bromide anion (a \nnegatively charged ion). This leaves the methyl group one \nelectron short, resulting in the formation of a positively \ncharged ion. This type of alkyl ion is called a carbocation. \nThese positively charged carbocations often appear in \nreaction mechanisms (see page 221). There are three \ntypes of carbocations that you need to consider: primary, \nsecondary and tertiary carbocations (Figure 14.24).\nH\nR\nR\nR\nR\nC+\nR\nC+\nC+\nH\nH\nR\nsecondary \ncarbocation\ntertiary carbocation\n(most stable)\nprimary carbocation\n(least stable)\nKey:  where R = an alkyl group\nFigure 14.24  Note that the carbon atom with the positive \ncharge only has three covalent bonds, not the usual four, \nmaking it electron deficient. Alkyl groups have the effect of \nspreading out the charge on the carbocation. The more alkyl \ngroups adjacent to the positively charged carbon atom, the \nmore stable the carbocation.\nThe type of carbocation formed in a reaction mechanism \ncan affect the products formed in some organic reactions, \nsuch as addition reactions to alkenes (see page 208). \nAlkyl groups (e.g.  \n CH3,  \n C2H5,  \n C3H7, etc.) tend \nto ‘push’ the electrons away from themselves. We say \nthat the electron-donating nature of alkyl groups has a \npositive inductive effect on adjacent groups. Therefore, \nin carbocations the more alkyl groups attached to the \npositively charged carbon, the less the charge density is on \nthe carbon atom with the three covalent bonds. Organic \nintermediates formed in the course of a reaction are \nenergetically more stable when any charge on a species is \nnot concentrated in one place but is spread over several \natoms. So when carbocations are formed as intermediates \nin reactions, the tertiary carbocation is most likely to form \nas its positive charge is, in effect, ‘smeared’ over the C+ \natom and the three carbon atoms it is bonded to.\nCarbocations are an example of a species called  \nan electrophile.\nAn electrophile is an acceptor of a pair of electrons.\n\nChapter 14: Introduction to organic chemistry\nWhen an electrophile accepts a pair of electrons this \nresults in the formation of a new covalent bond (see \npage 209).\nYou will also meet nucleophiles when studying organic \nreactions. These are electron-rich species, i.e. they carry a \nnegative, or partial negative, charge.\nA nucleophile is a donator of a pair of electrons.\nWhen a nucleophile donates a pair of electrons, this leads \nto the formation of a new covalent bond with the electron-\ndeficient atom under attack (see page 237).\nQuestion\n11\t a\t \u0007Write an equation to show the homolytic fission of \nthe Cl \n Cl bond in a chlorine molecule, Cl2.\nb\t \u0007Write an equation to show the heterolytic fission of \nthe C \n Cl bond in chloromethane.

This is commonly \nused, but the equation must still be balanced – just like a \nnormal equation.

They provide us with fuels such as \npetrol, diesel and kerosene. Hydrocarbons are also \nthe starting compounds we use to make many new \ncompounds, such as most of the plastics we meet in \neveryday life.\nThe homologous group of \nalkanes\nThe majority of compounds found in the mixture of \nhydrocarbons we call crude oil are alkanes. We have met \nthe first ten members of this homologous series in Table \n14.3 (page 192). The general formula for the alkanes is \nCnH2n + 2. For example, the molecular formula of pentane, \nin which n = 5, is C5H12. Figure 15.2 shows some different \nways of representing pentane molecules.\n202\n3D displayed formula\nof pentane, C5H12\n= C\n= H\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\ndisplayed formula\nof pentane\nC\nH\nC\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nstructural formula\nof pentane\nCH3CH2CH2CH2CH3\nskeletal formula\nof pentane\nFigure 15.2  The 3D displayed formula shows the \ntetrahedral arrangement of atoms around each carbon atom \n(approximate bond angles of 109.5º).\n\nFigure 15.1  Crude oil is extracted from porous seams of  \nrock found beneath an impervious layer of rock within the \nEarth’s crust.\nNote that all the carbon–carbon bonds are single covalent \nbonds. The carbon atoms all display sp3 hybridisation (see \npage 193). This means that alkanes have the maximum \nnumber of hydrogen atoms in their molecules and are \nknown as saturated hydrocarbons.\nQuestion\n1\t Eicosane is a straight-chain alkane whose molecules \ncontain 20 carbon atoms.\na\t \u0007What is the molecular formula of eicosane?\nb\t \u0007Draw the skeletal formula of eicosane.\nSources of the alkanes\nCrude oil is found trapped in layers of rock beneath the \nsurface of the Earth. The actual composition of crude oil \nvaries in different oilfields around the world.\n■\n■\nCrude oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons – alkanes, \ncycloalkanes and aromatic compounds.\n■\n■\nCycloalkanes are saturated hydrocarbons in which there is \na ‘ring’ consisting of three or more carbon atoms. Imagine \nthe two carbon atoms at each end of a straight-chain alkane \nbonding to each other. These two carbon atoms could then \nonly bond to two hydrogen atoms each, not three as in the \nstraight-chain alkane. Cyclohexane, C6H12, is an example \n(Figure 15.3).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nC\nH\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nskeletal formula\nof hexane\ndisplayed formula of hexane\nH\nH\nC\nH\nH\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nskeletal formula\nH\nH\nof cyclohexane\ndisplayed formula\nof cyclohexane\nFigure 15.3  Hexane, C6H14, and cyclohexane, C6H12.\nNote that a cycloalkane does not follow the general alkane \nformula, CnH2n + 2. This is because the two end carbon \natoms in an alkane chain bond to each other, forming a \nclosed ring. Therefore there are two fewer hydrogen atoms \nin a cycloalkane compared with its equivalent straight-\nchain alkane.\nAnother class of hydrocarbons called aromatic \nhydrocarbons, which are also known as arenes, are based \non hexagonal benzene rings (see Chapter 25).\nThe crude oil is brought to the surface at oil wells and \ntransported to an oil refinery. At the refinery the crude oil \nis processed into useful fuels. The first step is fractional \ndistillation of the oil. This separates the wide range of \ndifferent hydrocarbons into fractions. The hydrocarbons in \neach fraction will have similar boiling points. This is carried \nout in tall fractionating columns (Figure 15.4).\nThe lower the relative molecular mass of the \nhydrocarbons, the more volatile they are. They have lower \nboiling points and are collected nearer the top of the  \nfractionating columns. These compounds are in high \ndemand – especially the gasoline fraction (providing \npetrol) and the naphtha fraction (providing the starting \ncompounds for making many other chemicals in industry).\n\nChapter 15: Hydrocarbons\ncondenser\ngas\npump\nreflux\ngas separator\ngasoline\nand\nnaphtha\nreflux from\nkerosene\nfraction\nkerosene\nreflux from light\ngas oil fraction\nlight gas oil\nreflux from heavy\ngas oil fraction\nheavy gas oil\ncrude oil\nresidue\n203\npump\nheat\nsteam\nFigure 15.4  The fractional distillation of crude oil takes \nplace in a fractionating column.

The liquids are drawn off at \nthe bottom of the column while more volatile hydrocarbons \nrise up the column. They condense at different levels as the \ntemperature gradually falls and are collected as liquids. The \nmost volatile hydrocarbons, which are short-chain alkanes \n(methane to butane), leave the top of the column as gases.\nQuestion\n2\t a\t \u0007Draw the displayed formula and the skeletal \nformula of cyclopentane.\nb\t \u0007What is the general formula of cycloalkanes?\nc\t\n\u0007Give two differences between a molecule of \ncyclopentane and a molecule of pentane.\nd\t \u0007Which alkane would be collected at a higher \ntemperature from a fractionating column in an oil \nrefinery: ethane or decane?\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nReactions of alkanes\nThe alkanes are generally unreactive compounds. \nThis can be explained by the very small difference in \nelectronegativity between carbon and hydrogen. The \nalkane molecules are non-polar, so they are not attacked \nby nucleophiles or electrophiles. They have no partial \npositive charges on any of their carbon atoms to attract \nnucleophiles, neither do they have areas of high electron \ndensity to attract electrophiles (see page 197).\nHowever, the alkanes do react with oxygen in \ncombustion reactions and also undergo substitution by \nhalogens in sunlight. These reactions are covered in the \nnext sections.\n204\nFigure 15.5  Non-polar alkanes do not react with polar \ncompounds such as water. The hexane (which is dyed with \niodine to make it more clearly visible) and water shown here \nare immiscible – they do not mix and they do not react with \neach other.\nCombustion of alkanes\nAlkanes are often used as fuels (Figure 15.6). We burn \nthem for many reasons:\n■\n■\nto generate electricity in power stations\n■\n■\nto heat our homes and cook our food\n■\n■\nto provide energy needed in industrial processes\n■\n■\nto provide power for ships, aeroplanes, trains, lorries, \nbuses, cars and motorbikes.\nIf an alkane is burnt in plenty of oxygen, it will undergo \ncomplete combustion. The carbon will be oxidised fully to \nform carbon dioxide and the hydrogen will be oxidised to \nform water:\ncomplete\n\t\ncombustion\nalkane  +  oxygen  \n  carbon dioxide  +  water\n\nFigure 15.6  Alkanes are useful fuels.\nFor example, octane can be found in petrol. Some of it will \nundergo complete combustion in a car engine:\noctane +\noxygen\ncarbon dioxide +\nwater\n2C8H18 +\n25O2\n16CO2\n+ 18H2O\nThe equation can also be written as:\nC8H18\n+\n12​ 1 _ \n2 ​ O2\n8CO2\n+\n9H2O\nPollution from burning hydrocarbon \nfuels\nWhen the petrol or diesel is mixed with air inside a car \nengine, there is a limited supply of oxygen. Under these \nconditions, not all the carbon in the hydrocarbon fuel is \nfully oxidised to carbon dioxide. Some of the carbon is \nonly partially oxidised to form carbon monoxide gas. This \nis called incomplete combustion. For example:\nincomplete \ncombustion\noctane + oxygen\ncarbon monoxide + water\n2C8H18 +\n17O2\n16CO\n+ 18H2O\nor\nC8H18 +\n8​ 1 _ \n2 ​ O2\n8CO\n+ 9H2O\nCarbon monoxide is a toxic gas that bonds with \nthe haemoglobin in your blood. The haemoglobin \nmolecules can then no longer bond to oxygen and so \ncannot transport oxygen around your body. Victims of \ncarbon monoxide poisoning will feel dizzy, then lose \nconsciousness. If not removed from the toxic gas, the \nvictim will die. Carbon monoxide is odourless, so this\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nadds to the danger. This is why faulty gas heaters in which \nincomplete combustion occurs can kill unsuspecting \npeople in rooms with poor ventilation.\nAs well as carbon monoxide, road traffic also releases \nacidic nitrogen oxides. These contribute to the problem of \nacid rain. Acid rain can kill trees and aquatic animals in \nlakes (Figure 15.7). Acid raid also corrodes metals, such  \nas iron.\nFigure 15.7  These trees have been badly damaged by  \nacid rain.\nIn normal combustion, nitrogen gas in the air does not get \noxidised. However, in the very high temperatures in car \nengines oxidation of nitrogen does take place. A variety \nof nitrogen oxides can be formed and released in the car’s \nexhaust fumes (Figure 15.8). For example:\nN2(g)  +  O2(g)  \n  2NO(g)\nFigure 15.8  The vast numbers of cars on the roads pollute \nour atmosphere.\n\nChapter 15: Hydrocarbons\nAs well as toxic carbon monoxide and acidic nitrogen \noxides, cars also release unburnt hydrocarbons, often \nreferred to as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the \nair. Some of these are carcinogens (they cause cancers).\nCars can now be fitted with a catalytic converter in \ntheir exhaust system (Figure 15.9). Once warmed up, a \ncatalytic converter can cause the following reactions to \ntake place:\n■\n■\nthe oxidation of carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide\n■\n■\nthe reduction of nitrogen oxides to form harmless  \nnitrogen gas\n■\n■\nthe oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons to form carbon \ndioxide and water.\nUnfortunately, catalytic converters can do nothing to \nreduce the amount of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) \ngiven off in the exhaust gases of cars.\n205\nFigure 15.9  Catalytic converters reduce the pollutants from \ncar exhausts. Precious metals, such as platinum, are coated \non a honeycomb structure to provide a large surface area on \nwhich the reactions can occur.\nThe following equation describes the reaction between \ncarbon monoxide and nitrogen monoxide. It takes  \nplace on the surface of the precious metal catalyst in a \ncatalytic converter:\n2CO  +  2NO  \n  2CO2  +  N2\nNote that more carbon dioxide is released in place of \ncarbon monoxide. Carbon dioxide is not a toxic gas, but it \nis still considered a pollutant because of its contribution to \nenhanced global warming.\nCarbon dioxide occurs naturally in the air. The gas \nabsorbs infrared radiation given off by the Earth as it \ncools down at night. This helps to keep the Earth at the \nright temperature to support life. Without it all the water \non our planet would be constantly frozen. The problem \nof enhanced global warming has arisen because of the\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nhuge increase in the amount of CO2 produced by human \nactivity in the last 200 years. This extra CO2 traps more \nheat, and most scientists accept that this is causing the \naverage temperature of the Earth to rise. This increase in \ntemperature could cause rising sea levels, resulting in  \nthe flooding of low-lying areas of land. The climate will \nalso change around the world, with more extreme  \nweather predicted.\nEnvironmental scientists can monitor the pollutant \ngases in the air using an instrumental technique called \ninfrared spectroscopy (see Chapter 18, page 241). It works \nquickly and accurately to monitor pollutants, including \nnitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide \nand carbon dioxide, as well as more than a hundred \nVOCs and low-level ozone. The scientists can use the \ncharacteristic wavelengths of infrared radiation absorbed \nby the molecules of the pollutants to identify them. They \ncan also analyse the intensity of the absorptions to find \nthe concentration of each pollutant present in a sample. \nMonitored over a period of time, the scientists provide \nuseful information on the effectiveness of pollution control \nmeasures introduced locally and on a global level.\nSubstitution reactions of alkanes\n206\nquestions\n3\t a\t \u0007What would happen if octane was added to a \nsolution of sodium hydroxide?\nb\t \u0007Explain your answer to part a.\n4\t Give the balanced symbol equations for:\na\t \u0007the complete combustion of heptane, C7H16, giving \ncarbon dioxide and water\nb\t \u0007the incomplete combustion of methane, CH4, \ngiving carbon monoxide and water\nc\t\n\u0007the incomplete combustion of nonane, C9H20.\n5\t a\t \u0007Name two pollutants from a car engine that are \noxidised in a catalytic converter.\nb\t \u0007Name a pollutant that is reduced in a catalytic \nconverter.\nc\t\n\u0007Which pollutant from a car engine is not \ndiminished by the use of a catalytic converter? \nWhat environmental problem does this pollutant \ncontribute to?\nd\t \u0007What information about air pollution can the \ntechnique of infrared spectroscopy reveal to an \nenvironmental scientist?\n\nThe alkanes will undergo substitution reactions with \nhalogens in sunlight.

This is an \nexample of homolytic fission of a covalent bond (see page \n196). This is called the initiation step in the mechanism:\nUV light\nCl2  \n  2Cl\nAs the Cl \n Cl bond breaks, each chlorine atom takes one \nelectron from the pair of electrons in the Cl \n Cl bond. \nTwo Cl  atoms are formed. These Cl  atoms, each with an \nunpaired electron, are called free radicals.\nPropagation steps\nFree radicals are very reactive. They will attack the \nnormally unreactive alkanes. A chlorine free radical will \nattack the methane molecule:\nCH4  +  Cl   \n  CH3  +  HCl\nIn this propagation step, a C \n H bond in CH4 breaks\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nhomolytically. A methyl free radical, CH3, is produced. \nThis can then attack a chlorine molecule, forming \nchloromethane and regenerating a chlorine free radical:\nCH3  +  Cl2  \n  CH3Cl  +  Cl\nThen the first propagation step can be repeated as the \nchlorine free radical can attack another methane molecule. \nThis forms the methyl free radical, which regenerates \nanother chlorine free radical, and so on …\nThe word ‘propagation’ usually refers to growing \nnew plants. In this mechanism the substitution reaction \nprogresses (grows) in a kind of chain reaction.\nThis reaction is not really suitable for preparing \nspecific halogenoalkanes, because we get a mixture of \nsubstitution products. In the reaction between methane \nand chlorine, the products can include dichloromethane, \ntrichloromethane and tetrachloromethane as well \nas chloromethane. These other products result from \npropagation steps in which a chlorine free radical attacks a \nhalogenoalkane already formed. For example:\nCH3Cl  +  Cl   \n  CH2Cl  +  HCl\nThis can then be followed by:\nCH2Cl  +  Cl2  \n  CH2Cl2  +  Cl\ndichloromethane\nThe more chlorine gas in the reaction mixture to start \nwith, the greater the proportions of CH2Cl2, CHCl3 and \nCCl4 formed as products.\nTermination steps\nWhenever two free radicals meet they will react with  \neach other. A single molecule is the only product. \nAs no free radicals are made that can carry on the \nreaction sequence, the chain reaction stops.

Alkenes \nwith one double bond per molecule have the general \nformula CnH2n. One example is ethene, C2H4. Alkanes are \ndescribed as saturated hydrocarbons; however, alkenes are \ndescribed as unsaturated hydrocarbons.\nOil refineries provide useful alkenes for the chemical \nindustry. On page 203 we saw how crude oil is separated \ninto fractions at a refinery. Oil companies find that the \ndemand for the each fraction differs. The lighter fractions, \nsuch as the gasoline fraction, are in high demand. So, \nsome of the excess heavier fractions are converted to \nlighter hydrocarbons. The large, less useful hydrocarbon \nmolecules are broken down into smaller, more useful \nmolecules. The process is called cracking.\nThe larger hydrocarbon molecules are fed into a steel \nchamber that contains no oxygen, so combustion does \nnot take place. The larger hydrocarbon molecules are \nheated to a high temperature and are passed over a catalyst \n(Figure 15.11).\nWhen large alkane molecules are cracked they form \nsmaller alkane molecules and alkene molecules.

For example:\nCH2    CH2  +  HBr  \n  CH3CH2Br\nethene\t\n bromoethane\nWith longer, asymmetric alkenes there are always two \npossible products that could be formed.

This is because the CH3CHBrCH3 is formed \nfrom a secondary carbocation intermediate. On page \n197 we saw that this ion is more stable than the primary \ncarbocation so is more readily formed in the course of \na reaction.

In fact, bromine water \nis used to test for the presence of the C   C bond in \ncompounds. The compound to be tested is shaken with \nbromine water.

There are four \nelectrons in total in these two bonds. So although ethene \nis a non-polar molecule, there is an area of high electron \ndensity around the C   C bond. This makes the alkenes \nopen to attack by electrophiles (see page 197).\nRemember that an electrophile is an acceptor of a \npair of electrons. HBr is a polar molecule because of the \ndifference in electronegativity between the H atom and the \nBr atom. In a molecule of HBr, the H atom carries a partial \npositive charge and the Br atom carries a partial negative \ncharge. In the mechanism of addition, the H atom acts as \nthe electrophile, accepting a pair of electrons from the  \nC   C bond in the alkene.\nBut how can a non-polar molecule such as Br2 act as \nan electrophile? As the bromine molecule and ethene \nmolecules approach each other, the area of high electron \ndensity around the C   C bond repels the pair of electrons \nin the Br \n Br bond away from the nearer Br atom. \nThis makes the nearer Br atom slightly positive and the \nfurther Br atom slightly negative.

A polymer is a long-\nchain molecule made up of many repeating units. The small, \nreactive molecules that react together to make the polymer \nare called monomers. Up to 10 000 ethene monomers can \nbond together to form the polymer chains of poly(ethene). \nPoly(ethene) is commonly used to make carrier bags. \nOther alkenes also polymerise to make polymers with \ndifferent properties. Examples of other poly(alkenes) include \npoly(propene) and poly(phenylethene).\nWe can show the polymerisation reaction of ethene as:\nnC2H4 \n  [–C2H4 ]–n \n\t ethene\t\npoly(ethene)\nor by using the displayed formulae:\nH\nH\nH\nH\nn\nC\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nn\nn is very large, e.g. up to 10 000\n211\nThe section of the polymer shown in the brackets is the \nrepeat unit of the polymer.\nThe reaction is called addition polymerisation.

During their \nuseful life, one of the poly(alkene)s’ useful properties is \ntheir lack of reactivity. As they are effectively huge alkane \nmolecules, they are resistant to chemical attack. So they \ncan take hundreds of years to decompose when dumped \nin landfill sites, taking up valuable space. They are non-\nbiodegradable. Therefore throwing away poly(alkenes)\ncreates rubbish that will pollute the environment for \ncenturies (Figure 15.19).\nBurning plastic waste\nOne way to solve this problem would be to burn the \npoly(alkene)s and use the energy released to generate \nelectricity.

Unlike some of the elements from which \nthey are formed, such as fluorine and chlorine, many\nFigure 16.1  An anaesthetist putting a patient to sleep before \nan operation.\nNucleophilic substitution \nreactions\n218\nWe can think of the halogenoalkanes as alkanes that have \none or more hydrogen atoms replaced by halogen atoms.\nRemember that the halogens are the elements in Group \n17 of the Periodic Table, namely fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), \nbromine (Br) and iodine (I).\nThe simplest halogenoalkanes, whose molecules contain \njust one halogen atom, will have the general formula \nCnH2n + 1X, where X is F, Cl, Br or I. The presence of the \nhalogen atom has a huge effect on the reactivity of the \nhalogenoalkanes compared with that of the alkanes.\n\nhalogenoalkanes are relatively unreactive under \nnormal conditions. This leads to their use as flame \nretardants and anaesthetics.\nIf you have ever had an operation, you may have a \nhalogenoalkane to thank for putting you to sleep. \nYou might have heard of an early anaesthetic called \nchloroform. Its systematic name is trichloromethane. \nNowadays you may receive a gas known as ‘halothane’:\nF\nCl\nC\nF\nC\nBr\nF\nH\nHowever, under other conditions, such as high in the \nEarth’s stratosphere, some halogenoalkanes react in \ncompletely different ways.\n1  Substitution reactions with aqueous \nalkali, OH–(aq)\nWhen an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide is added \nto a halogenoalkane, a nucleophilic substitution reaction \ntakes place. The halogen atom in the halogenoalkane \nis replaced by an \n OH, hydroxyl group, so the organic \nproduct formed is an alcohol:\nCH3CH2Br  +  NaOH   \n   CH3CH2OH  +  NaBr\n\t bromoethane\t\nethanol\nWe can also show this equation as:\nCH3CH2Br  +  OH–   \n   CH3CH2OH  +  Br–\nThe aqueous hydroxide ion behaves as a nucleophile here, \nbecause it is donating a pair of electrons to the carbon \natom bonded to the halogen in the halogenoalkane. This is \nwhy the reaction is called a nucleophilic substitution.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nHydrolysis of a halogenoalkane\nThe reaction is carried out under reflux in the \nlaboratory. This enables us to heat the reaction \nmixture without evaporating off the volatile \norganic compounds in the reaction flask. The \napparatus is shown in Figure 16.2.\nwater out\ncondenser\nwater in\nhalogenoalkane\n+\nalkali (OH–)\nanti-bumping\ngranules\nheat\nFigure 16.2  Reflux apparatus for hydrolysis  \nof a halogenoalkane.\nSimilar reactions occur with other \nhalogenoalkanes, but the reaction rates differ. \nWe can investigate the rate of hydrolysis using \naqueous silver nitrate solution. The water in the \nsilver nitrate solution acts as the nucleophile, \nand again an alcohol is formed. The reaction is \ncalled hydrolysis (meaning ‘breakdown by water’):\nCH3CH2Br  +  H2O   \n   CH3CH2OH  +  H+  +  Br –\nIt is a very similar reaction to the reaction that \ntakes place with aqueous alkali.\nHowever, the hydrolysis with water occurs more \nslowly than with OH–(aq). This is because the \nnegatively charged hydroxide ion is a more effective \nnucleophile than a neutral water molecule.\nFrom the equation above, you can see that a halide \nion, in this case Br –, is produced in the reaction.\n\nChapter 16: Halogenoalkanes\nOn page 175 we used silver nitrate solution to test for \nhalide ions. Remember that aqueous chlorides give a \nwhite precipitate (silver chloride), bromides give a cream \nprecipitate (silver bromide) and iodides produce a pale \nyellow precipitate (silver iodide). The water in the silver \nnitrate solution will hydrolyse a halogenoalkane.\nObserving this reaction, we can time how long it takes \nfor test tubes containing the halogenoalkanes and aqueous \nsilver nitrate solution to become opaque.\nWe find that:\n■\n■\nthe fastest nucleophilic substitution reactions take place \nwith the iodoalkanes\n■\n■\nthe slowest nucleophilic substitution reactions take place \nwith the fluoroalkanes.\nThe substitution reaction involves the breaking of the \ncarbon   halogen bond. Looking at the bond energies\nFluoroalkanes\t\nleast reactive\nChloroalkanes\nBromoalkanes\nIodoalkanes\t\nmost reactive\n219\n(Table 16.1) helps us to explain the rates of reaction. Notice \nthat the C– I bond is the weakest, so it is broken most \neasily. It forms an I– ion during the substitution reaction. \nThis is shown clearly in an ionic equation:\nCH3CH2I  +  OH–  \n  CH3CH2OH  +  I–\niodooethane\t\nethanol\nThere is more about the mechanism of nucleophilic \nsubstitution on pages 220–1.\nBond\nBond energy / kJ mol–1\nC    F\n467 (strongest bond)\nC    Cl\n346\nC    Br\n290\nC    I\n228 (weakest bond)\nTable 16.1  Bond energy values of the carbon–halogen bonds.\n2  Substitution with cyanide ions, CN– \n(in ethanol)\nIn this reaction the nucleophile is the cyanide, CN–, ion. \nTo carry out the reaction, a solution of potassium cyanide, \nKCN, in ethanol (known as an ethanolic or alcoholic\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nsolution of potassium cyanide) is made up. This is then \nheated under reflux with the halogenoalkane. An ionic \nequation for this reaction is:\nCH3CH2Br  +  CN–  \n  CH3CH2CN  +  Br–\nbromoethane\t\npropanenitrile\nNote that in the reaction with the cyanide ion, an extra \ncarbon atom is added to the original halogenoalkane chain. \nIn this case, bromoethane is converted to propanenitrile.\nSometimes in industry chemists need to make a new \ncompound with one more carbon atom than the best \navailable organic raw material (the starting compound). \nTherefore, if we can convert the starting compound to a \nhalogenoalkane, we can then reflux with ethanolic KCN to \nmake a nitrile. We now have an intermediate nitrile with \nthe correct number of carbon atoms. \nWe will consider nitriles and their subsequent \nconversion to carboxylic acids and amines again in \nChapter 18, page 231.\n3  Substitution with ammonia, NH3  \n(in ethanol)\nIf a halogenoalkane is heated with an excess of ammonia \ndissolved in ethanol under pressure, an amine is formed.\n220\nCH3CH2Br  +  NH3  \n  CH3CH2NH2  +  HBr\n\t bromoethane\t\nethylamine\nHere the nucleophile is the ammonia molecule. \nEthylamine is a primary amine, as the nitrogen atom is \nattached to only one alkyl group. If the ammonia is not  \nin excess, we get a mixture of amine products. This \nis because the primary amine product will act as a \nnucleophile itself and will attack halogenoalkane \nmolecules, forming secondary amines, and so on. The \nsecondary amine formed above would be (CH3CH2)2NH, \ncalled diethylamine.

In these reactions, the nucleophile attacks \nthe carbon atom bonded to the halogen. Remember from \nChapter 14 that nucleophiles are donors of an electron pair \nand are attracted to electron-deficient atoms.\nThe carbon–halogen bond is polarised because the \nhalogen is more electronegative than carbon. Therefore \nthe carbon atom carries a partial positive charge as the \nelectron pair in the carbon–halogen bond is drawn  \nnearer to the halogen atom (shown in Figure 16.3). \nThe halogen atom is replaced by the nucleophile in the \nsubstitution reaction.\nH\nδ+\nC\nδ–\nX\nH\nH\nFigure 16.3  The carbon–halogen bond is polarised.\nThere are two possible mechanisms that can operate in the \nnucleophilic substitution reactions of halogenoalkanes. \nThe mechanism is determined by the structure of the \nhalogenoalkane involved in the reaction.\nMechanism for primary halogenoalkanes \n(SN2)\nIn primary halogenoalkanes containing one halogen \natom, the halogen atom is bonded to a carbon atom, \nwhich is itself bonded to one other carbon atom and \ntwo hydrogen atoms. This means that the carbon atom \nbonded to the halogen is attached to one alkyl group. For \nexample, 1-chloropropane, CH3CH2CH2Cl, is a primary \nhalogenoalkane. On page 220 we looked at the hydrolysis \nof bromoethane, another primary halogenoalkane. \nFigure 16.4 shows the mechanism for that reaction.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nH\nH\nδ+\nH\nC\nH\nHO–\nC\nH\nC\nH\nC\nδ–\nBr\nH\nFigure 16.4  The mechanism of nucleophilic substitution in a primary halogenoalkane.\nThe OH– ion donates a pair of electrons to the δ+ carbon \natom, forming a new covalent bond. At the same time, \nthe C   Br bond is breaking. The Br atom takes both the \nelectrons in the bond (an example of heterolytic fission of a \ncovalent bond, see page 196) and leaves as a Br– ion.\nThis mechanism is called an SN2 mechanism. The ‘S’ \nstands for substitution and the ‘N’ stands for nucleophilic. \nThe ‘2’ tells us that the rate of the reaction, which is \ndetermined by the slow step in the mechanism (see page \n141), involves two reacting species. Experiments show us \nthat the rate depends on both the concentration of the \nhalogenoalkane and the concentration of the hydroxide \nions present.\nMechanism for tertiary halogenoalkanes \n(SN1)\nIn a tertiary halogenoalkane, the carbon atom bonded \nto the halogen atom is also bonded to three other \ncarbon atoms (alkyl groups). For example, 2-bromo-2-\nmethylpropane is a tertiary halogenoalkane. Its structure \nis shown in Figure 16.5.\nH\nH\nC\nH\nH\nH\nC\nH\nC\nC\nH\nH\nBr\nH\nFigure 16.5  A tertiary halogenoalkane,  \n2-bromo-2-methylpropane.\nA tertiary halogenoalkane reacts with a hydroxide ion by \na two-step mechanism.

The \n‘1’ tells us that the rate of the reaction only depends \non one reagent, in this case the concentration of the \nhalogenoalkane, as shown in the first (slow) step of the \nmechanism. \nOnce again, this breaking of the C   Br bond is an \nexample of heterolytic fission.\nThe Br– ion forms again, as in the SN2 mechanism,  \nbut in this mechanism a carbocation ion forms. This \ndoes not happen with primary halogenoalkanes. This \nis because tertiary carbocations are more stable than \nprimary carbocations due to the inductive effect of the \nalkyl groups attached to the carbon atom bonded to  \nthe halogen. Alkyl groups tend to release electrons \nto atoms attached to them. So a tertiary carbocation \nhas three alkyl groups donating electrons towards the \npositively charged carbon atom, reducing its charge \ndensity. This makes it more stable than a primary \ncarbocation, which just has one alkyl group releasing \nelectrons (Figure 16.7).\nThe SN1 mechanism and the SN2 mechanism are both \nlikely to play a part in the nucleophilic substitution of \nsecondary halogenoalkanes.\n221\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nC\nH\nC\nC\nH\nC\nH\nC\nC+\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nprimary carbocation\n(least stable)\nFigure 16.7  The trend in the stability of primary, secondary and tertiary carbocations.\nquestions\n3\t \u0007Show the mechanism, including appropriate curly \narrows, for the hydrolysis of 1-chloropropane, \nCH3CH2CH2Cl, by alkali.\n4\t \u0007a\t \u0007Draw the structure (displayed formula) of  \n2-chloro-2-methylbutane.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Show the mechanism for the hydrolysis of \n2-chloro-2-methylbutane by alkali.\nElimination reactions\n222\nHalogenoalkanes also undergo elimination reactions. An \nelimination reaction involves the loss of a small molecule \nfrom the original organic molecule. In the case of \nhalogenoalkanes, this small molecule is a hydrogen halide, \nsuch as HCl or HBr.\nThe reagent used in these elimination reactions is \nethanolic sodium hydroxide:\nCH3CHBrCH3  +  NaOH(ethanol) \n\t 2-bromopropane\nCH2\n  CHCH3  +  H2O  +  NaBr\n\t\npropene\nThe original 2-bromopropane molecule has lost an H atom \nand a Br atom. We can think of it as HBr being eliminated \nfrom the halogenoalkane. The ethanolic OH– ion acts as \na base, accepting an H+ from the halogenoalkane to form \nwater. The C   Br bond breaks heterolytically, forming a \nBr– ion and leaving an alkene as the organic product.\nNotice the importance of the conditions used in \norganic reactions. If we use NaOH(aq), a nucleophilic \nsubstitution reaction occurs and an alcohol is produced. \nIf we use NaOH(ethanol), an elimination reaction occurs \nand an alkene is produced.\n\nH\nH\nH\nC\n+\nC\n+\nC\nH\nH\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nsecondary carbocation\ntertiary carbocation\n(most stable)\nQuestion\n5\t \u0007Write a balanced equation for the reaction of \nbromoethane with ethanolic sodium hydroxide.\nUses of halogenoalkanes\nHalogenoalkanes are rarely found naturally but they are \nimportant in the chemical industry. They are frequently \nmade as intermediates for making other useful substances \nbut have also found some uses themselves. We have \nalready seen at the start of this chapter how some \nhalogenoalkanes are important anaesthetics, for example \n2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (halothane). One \nof the essential properties of an anaesthetic is chemical \ninertness, and each halothane molecule contains three \nvery strong C   F bonds that are difficult to break, \nmaking halothane inert and safe to use in the aqueous \nenvironment inside the body.\nThe non-stick lining of pans is a ‘fluoropolymer’. Its \nname is poly(tetrafluoroethene) – often referred to by its \ntrade name Teflon®. The strength of the C   F bond means \nthat it can be used at high temperatures during cooking \nwithout breaking down. The polymer is now finding uses \nin ice-skating blades because of its durability and its ‘low-\nfriction’ properties.\nCFC substitutes containing fluorine\nCFCs are chlorofluorocarbons. Chemists refer to them \nas chlorofluoroalkanes. These organic compounds are all \nchemically inert (very unreactive). They are not flammable \nand are not toxic. These properties made volatile \nCFCs useful as aerosol propellants, solvents and as the \nrefrigerants inside fridges. They were also used as blowing \nagents for polymers such as expanded polystyrene.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nDichlorodifluoromethane is an example of a CFC used for \nthese purposes.\nWhen the compounds were discovered in the 1930s, \npeople could see no drawbacks to using the new ‘wonder \ncompounds’. However, CFCs have caused a serious \nenvironmental issue – the depletion of the ozone layer in \nthe upper atmosphere. The ozone layer protects the Earth by \nabsorbing harmful UV radiation arriving from the Sun.\nIt turns out that CFCs are unreactive in normal \nconditions, but high up in the atmosphere they become \ntotally different. The CFCs can persist in the atmosphere \nfor about a hundred years. They diffuse up to the \nstratosphere – and that’s where the problem starts. The \nUV light from the Sun breaks the C   Cl bonds in the \nCFC molecules. This releases highly reactive chlorine \natoms, called chlorine free radicals. These chlorine free \nradicals react with ozone molecules. In a sequence of \nchain reactions, it has been estimated that each chlorine \nfree radical can destroy a million ozone molecules \n(Figure 16.8).\nGovernments have tackled the problem, and most \nindustrialised countries have now banned the use of CFCs. \nChemists developed new compounds for fridges and \naerosols, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs): for example, \nCH2FCF3. These non-chlorinated compounds break down \nmore quickly once released into the air because of the \npresence of hydrogen in their molecules, so they never rise \nin the atmosphere as far as the ozone layer. There are now \nsigns that the ozone layer is recovering from the effects of \nCFCs. The hole in the ozone layer is very slowly closing up.\nSummary\n■\t If one or more of the hydrogen atoms in an alkane \nmolecule are replaced by halogen atoms, the \ncompound is called a halogenoalkane.\n■\t Iodoalkanes are the most reactive halogenoalkanes, \nwhereas fluoroalkanes are the least reactive. This \nis explained by the trend in the bond strength of \nthe carbon–halogen bonds. The C   F bond is the \nstrongest bond, and the C   I bond is the weakest \nbond. So the C   I bond is most easily broken during \nits reactions.\n■\t Halogenoalkanes are attacked by nucleophiles. This \nhappens because the carbon bonded to the halogen \ncarries a partial positive charge due to the higher \nelectronegativity of the halogen. Halogenoalkanes \nundergo nucleophilic substitution.\n\nChapter 16: Halogenoalkanes\nFigure 16.8  Banning the use of CFCs has meant that the hole \nin the ozone layer over Antarctica is now getting smaller.\nHFEs are hydrofluoroethers, which are solvents \nmarketed as ‘low global warming’ and are used in industry \nfor cleaning and drying. When fluorine replaces chlorine \nin a solvent the new compound is more stable, again due to \nC   F being stronger than C   Cl.\n223\nQuestion\n6\t \u0007How can such unreactive compounds as CFCs cause \nso much damage to the ozone layer?\n■\t Suitable nucleophiles include aqueous alkali,  \nOH– (aq), cyanide, CN–, and ammonia, NH3.\n■\t The reaction with OH– ions (or with water) is known \nas hydrolysis, and an alcohol is formed.\n■\t Halogenoalkanes will also undergo elimination \nreactions when heated with ethanolic sodium \nhydroxide, forming alkenes.\n■\t The fluoroalkanes and fluorohalogenoalkanes \nhave many uses, including anaesthetics, solvents, \nrefrigerants and aerosol propellants.\n■\t Chlorofluoroalkanes have been responsible for \ndamaging the Earth’s ozone layer, but alternative \ninert compounds, such as fluoroalkanes, are now \nreplacing the use of CFCs.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nEnd-of-chapter questions\n1  1-bromobutane will undergo reactions when heated, as shown by reactions A and B.\nCH3CH2CH2CH2Br\nA\nB\nCH3CH2CH2CH2OH\nCH3CH2CH=CH2\n \n a  For reactions A and B give the reagents used in each case. \n[2]\n \n b  Reaction A was repeated using 1-iodobutane instead of 1-bromobutane.

The sugar extracted \nfrom crops such as sugar cane and sugar beet can be \nfermented with yeast to make ethanol. Ethanol is  \na ‘biofuel’ and burns with a clean flame. This  \nprocess is becoming increasingly important as our \nsupplies of crude oil diminish and cleaner, easier to \nproduce biofuels are needed to take the place of petrol \nand diesel.\nThe homologous series of \nalcohols\nAlcohols are organic molecules containing the hydroxyl \ngroup, \n OH. With one hydroxyl group substituted into  \nan alkane molecule, the general formula is CnH2n + 1OH. \nThe alcohols are named by adding ‘-anol’ to the alkane \nstem. For example, CH3OH is called methanol. For alcohol \nmolecules with three or more carbon atoms, the position \nof the hydroxyl group is shown by inserting a number to \nindicate which carbon atom is bonded to the OH group. \nFigure 17.2 gives some examples.\n226\nCH3\nCH3\nCH2\nOH\nH3C\nCH\nOH\nH3C\nCH2\nH3C\nC\nOH\nCH3\npropan-1-ol\nprimary alcohol\npropan-2-ol\nsecondary alcohol\n2-methylpropan-2-ol\ntertiary alcohol\nFigure 17.2  Note that the numbering to show the position of \nthe OH group in an alcohol starts from the end of the molecule \nthat gives the smaller number.\nPropan-1-ol is classified as a primary alcohol. The carbon \natom bonded to the \n OH group is attached to one other \ncarbon atom (alkyl group). Propan-2-ol is a secondary \nalcohol as the carbon atom bonded to the \n OH group is \nattached to two other carbon atoms (alkyl groups). With \nthree alkyl groups attached, 2-methylpropan-2-ol is an \nexample of a tertiary alcohol.\nThe alcohols have higher boiling points than expected \nwhen compared with other organic molecules with similar\n\nFigure 17.1  The sugar extracted from sugar cane can be \nfermented with yeast to make ethanol.\nrelative molecular masses. Even methanol, the alcohol with \nthe lowest molar mass, is a liquid at room temperature. \nThis occurs because of hydrogen bonding between alcohol \nmolecules (see page 64). Hydrogen bonding also explains \nwhy the smaller alcohol molecules mix and dissolve so \nwell in water.\nQuestion\n1\t \u0007a\t \u0007Explain how hydrogen bonds arise:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007between ethanol molecules\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007between ethanol and water molecules.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Ethanol mixes with water in all proportions but \nhexan-1-ol is less miscible with water. Why is this?\nReactions of the alcohols\n1  Combustion\nWhen ignited, the alcohols react with oxygen in the air. \nThe products of complete combustion are carbon dioxide \nand water. For example, ethanol burns with a clean blue \nflame in a good supply of air:\nalcohol\t +\t oxygen\t\n\t carbon dioxide\t +\t water\nC2H5OH  \t+\t\n3O2\t\n\t\n2CO2\t\n+\t 3H2O\n\t\nethanol\nEthanol is sometimes used in Brazil as a car fuel. This \nreduces the use of petrol.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nA country like Brazil has few oil reserves but can grow plenty \nof sugar cane, which can be fermented to make ethanol, \nwhich is used as a fuel either in pure form or in mixtures with \nother fuels (Figure 17.3). As well as conserving the world’s \ndiminishing supplies of crude oil, sugar cane has the advantage \nof absorbing CO2 as it grows. Although the CO2 is effectively \nreturned to the atmosphere during fermentation and when the \nethanol burns, biofuels such as ethanol are said to be ‘carbon \nneutral’. Overall, they do not increase the greenhouse gases \nin the air (in theory). Even if we take into account the CO2 \nproduced in growing, harvesting, transporting and processing \nthe sugar cane, it is still much better for the environment to use \n‘bio-ethanol’ as a fuel than petrol or diesel from crude oil.\nFigure 17.3  The fuel called ‘gasohol’ is a mixture of ethanol \nand petrol.\nEthanol is used as a solvent as well as a fuel. We often use it \nas ‘methylated spirits’, which contains about 90% ethanol.\nQuestion\n2\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write a balanced equation for the complete \ncombustion of:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007propan-1-ol\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007butan-1-ol.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Glucose can be fermented with yeast in anaerobic \nconditions. Name the products of the reaction.\n2  Substitution to form a halogenoalkane\nIn this substitution reaction with a hydrogen halide, such \nas hydrogen chloride, the \n OH group in the alcohol is \nreplaced by a halogen atom to produce a halogenoalkane. \nThe carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group in the \nalcohol will carry a partial positive charge (as oxygen is \nmore electronegative than carbon). This makes the carbon\n\nChapter 17: Alcohols, esters and carboxylic acids\natom open to nucleophilic attack. The initial attack on the \nalcohol is by the partially negative halogen atom in the \nhydrogen halide:\nδ+\nH\nδ–\nX\nwhere X = halogen atom\nalcohol + hydrogen halide  \n  halogenoalkane + water\nFor example:\nCH3CH2OH + HCl  \n  CH3CH2Cl + 3H2O\n\t\nethanol\t\nchloroethane\nThe dry hydrogen chloride gas for this reaction can be \nmade in situ (in the reaction vessel). Sodium chloride and \nconcentrated sulfuric acid are used for this:\nNaCl  +  H2SO4  \n  NaHSO4  +  HCl\nHalogenation of an alcohol\nThe alcohol is heated under reflux (see apparatus \non page 219) with the reactants to make the \nhalogenoalkane. The halogenoalkane made can \nthen be distilled off from the reaction mixture and \ncollected as oily droplets under water (Figure 17.4).\n227\nFigure 17.4  Bromoethane being distilled off following \nthe reaction between ethanol and hydrogen bromide. \nThe white solid visible in the pear-shaped flask is sodium \nbromide (as crystals). The sodium bromide reacts with \nconcentrated sulfuric acid to make the hydrogen bromide \nneeded for the reaction.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nSulfur dichloride oxide, SOCl2, can also be used to \nsubstitute a chlorine atom into an alcohol molecule, as \nshown below:\nC2H5OH  +  SOCl2  \n  C2H5Cl  +  HCl  +  SO2\nNote that in this reaction the two byproducts of the \nreaction (HCl and SO2) are both gases. These escape from \nthe reaction mixture, leaving the halogenoalkane, without \nthe need to distil it off as in the hydrogen halide reaction.\nWe can also use phosphorus halides to provide the \nhalogen atoms for this substitution reaction.\nFor chloroalkanes we can use solid phosphorus(V) \nchloride, PCl5:\nroom temperature\nC2H5OH  +  PCl5  \n C2H5Cl  +  HCl  +  POCl3\nThe release of acidic hydrogen chloride gas from this \nreaction can be used as a test for the hydroxyl group. The \nHCl gas causes acidic ‘steamy fumes’ to be observed.\nPhosphorus(III) chloride can also be used to halogenate \nan alcohol, but this reaction does require heating.\nFor bromoalkanes and iodoalkanes we can make \nthe phosphorus(III) halide, PBr3 or PI3, in situ using red \nphosphorus and bromine or iodine. These are warmed \nwith the alcohol. For example:\n228\n3C2H5OH  +  PI3  \n  3C2H5I  +  H3PO3\n\t\niodoethane\nQuestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write a balanced equation to show the reaction \nbetween ethanol and hydrogen bromide.\n\u0007b\t \u0007What are the reagents and conditions used for  \nthis reaction?\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007What do we call this type of reaction?\n3  Reaction with sodium metal\nIn the reaction with hydrogen halides, the C   O bond in \nthe alcohol breaks. However, in some other reactions the  \nO   H bond in the alcohol breaks. The reaction with \nsodium metal is an example:\nC2H5OH  +  Na  \n  C2H5O–Na+  +  H2\n\t\nethanol\t\nsodium\t\nsodium ethoxide\t hydrogen\nThe reaction is similar to sodium’s reaction with water, but \nless vigorous. In both cases hydrogen gas is given off and\n\na basic ionic compound is formed. With ethanol, if the \nexcess ethanol is evaporated off after the reaction, a white \ncrystalline solid is left. This is the sodium ethoxide.\nOther alcohols react in a similar way with sodium. For \nexample, propan-1-ol would produce sodium propoxide \nplus hydrogen gas. \nIn general:\nalcohol  +  sodium  \n  sodium alkoxide  +  hydrogen\nWe find that the longer the hydrocarbon chain, the less \nvigorous the reaction.\nFigure 17.5  Sodium reacting with ethanol.

An esterification reaction is usually \nbetween an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. The \ngeneral equation is:\nacid catalyst\ncarboxylic acid  +  alcohol \n ester  +  water\nFor this reaction to take place, the carboxylic acid \nand alcohol are heated under reflux with a strong \nacid catalyst (usually concentrated sulfuric acid). \nThe reaction is reversible, so an equilibrium can \nbe established with all the reactants and products \nshown in the general equation present.\nThe esters formed usually have sweet, fruity smells. \nThey are present naturally in fruits, and we use  \nthem in artificial flavourings and perfumes \n(Figure 17.6). They are also used as solvents, e.g. in \nnail varnish remover.\nHere is an example of an esterification reaction:\nO\nH2SO 4\nO\nCH3C\nC2H5OH\nH2O\n+\n+\nCH3C\nOH\nOC2H5\nethanoic acid\nethyl ethanoate\nwater\nethanol\nThe ester formed is called ethyl ethanoate.\nWhat would be the name of the ester formed if \nethanol was reacted with propanoic acid? Would it be \npropyl ethanoate or ethyl propanoate? The answer\nHydrolysis of esters\nEsters can be hydrolysed by heating under reflux with \neither an acid or a base.\nRefluxing with an acid simply reverses the preparation \nof the ester from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. The \nacid catalyses the reaction. The reaction is reversible and \nan equilibrium mixture is established. In acid hydrolysis, \nthere are always both reactants (ester + water) and \nproducts (carboxylic acid + alcohol) present after the \nreaction. The equation for the acid hydrolysis of the ester \nethyl ethanoate is:\n\nChapter 17: Alcohols, esters and carboxylic acids\nFigure 17.6  Esters contribute to the complex mixture of \nsubstances blended in a perfume.\n229\nis ethyl propanoate. That’s because the first part of \nan ester’s name comes from the alcohol: in this case \nethanol, giving ‘ethyl …’. The second part comes \nfrom the carboxylic acid, in this case propanoic acid, \ngiving ‘… propanoate’, thus making the name of the \nester formed ‘ethyl propanoate’:\nCH3CH2COOH  +  C2H5OH\n\t propanoic acid\t\nethanol\n\t\nH2SO4  CH3CH2COOC2H5  +  H2O\n\t\n\t ethyl propanoate\t\nwater\nO\nO\nH+(aq)\n+  H2O\nH3C\nH3C\nC\n+  CH3CH2OH\nC\nCH2CH3\nH\nO\nO\nHowever, when an ester is refluxed with an alkali (a \nsoluble base), such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, it is \nfully hydrolysed. Unlike acid hydrolysis, this is not a \nreversible reaction, so all the ester present can be broken \ndown by excess alkali. An alcohol and the sodium salt of \nthe carboxylic acid are formed. The equation for the base \nhydrolysis of ethyl ethanoate is:\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nO\nO\n+  CH3CH2OH\nH3C\nCH2CH3\nH3C\nC\nC\n+  NaOH\nO–\nNa+\nO\nsodium\nethanoate\nQuestion\n5\t \u0007a\t \u0007Name the ester formed in each of the following \nreactions:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007butan-1-ol + ethanoic acid\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007ethanol + hexanoic acid\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007pentan-1-ol and methanoic acid.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Write the structural formula of each ester formed \nin part a.\n5  Dehydration\nAlcohols can also undergo elimination reactions in which \nwater is lost and alkenes are formed.

The concentrated acid does not change \nchemically during the reaction.\n\u0007a\t \u0007Write an equation showing the dehydration of \nethanol using concentrated sulfuric acid.\n\u0007b\t \u0007If propan-1-ol was used instead of ethanol, name \nthe organic product formed.\n6  Oxidation\nOn page 226 we saw how alcohols can be classified as \nprimary, secondary or tertiary. For many of their reactions, \nthe class of alcohol makes no difference to the type of \nproducts formed. In organic chemistry, we can usually \ngeneralise for the whole homologous series. However, when \nalcohols are oxidised, different products are obtained from \nprimary, secondary and tertiary alcohols.\nAlcohols can be oxidised by potassium dichromate(VI) \nsolution, K2Cr2O7, acidified with dilute sulfuric acid. The \nsolution’s orange colour is caused by the dichromate(VI) \nions, Cr2O7\n2–(aq). When the dichromate(VI) ions react as \nan oxidising agent, they themselves are reduced and turn \ninto chromium(III) ions, Cr3+(aq), which form a green \nsolution. The reaction mixture needs to be warmed before \nthe oxidation takes place.\nThe product formed when an alcohol is oxidised can \nbe used to distinguish between primary, secondary and \ntertiary alcohols. You can learn about the chemical tests \nfor the products on pages 238–9.\n■\n■\nWith tertiary alcohols, a mixture of the tertiary alcohol, \ndilute sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate(VI) solution \nremains orange when warmed. No reaction takes place \nunder these relatively mild conditions.\n■\n■\nA secondary alcohol, such as propan-2-ol, will be oxidised \nto form a ketone. In this case propanone is formed and the \nreaction mixture turns green:\nOH\nO\nC\nCH3 + [O] ⎯→\nH3C\nC\nH3C\nCH3 + H2O\npropanone\nH\nThese oxidation equations use [O] to show the oxygen \nadded from the oxidising agent. You have met this type \nof simplified equation for oxidation reactions before on \npage 198.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n■\n■\nWith a primary alcohol, such as ethanol, the alcohol is \noxidised to an aldehyde. Ethanol is oxidised to ethanal:\nO\nethanal\nCH3CH2OH  +  [O]\nC\n⎯→H3C\nH   +  H2O\nThe ethanal formed can be further oxidised to form \nethanoic acid, a carboxylic acid. This is achieved by \nrefluxing with excess acidified potassium dichromate(VI):\nO\nO\nethanoic acid\nH3C\nC\nH  +  [O] ⎯→\nH3C\nOH\nC\nDistinguishing tertiary alcohols\nGiven three unknown alcohols, one primary, one \nsecondary and one tertiary, it would be easy to \ndistinguish the tertiary alcohol. Figure 17.8 shows \nthe results of warming each class of alcohol with \na solution of acidified potassium dichromate(VI). \nMore details of these reactions are given on page \n236.\nFigure 17.8  Before warming with the labelled alcohol, \neach of these tubes contained orange acidified \npotassium dichromate(VI) solution. After warming, \nthe orange dichromate(VI) ions have been reduced to \ngreen chromium(III) ions by the primary and secondary \nalcohols. This shows that both the primary and \nsecondary alcohols have been oxidised but the tertiary \nalcohol, 2-methylpropan-2-ol, has not.\n\nChapter 17: Alcohols, esters and carboxylic acids\nQuestion\n7\t \u0007Propan-1-ol can be oxidised to propanal, CH3CH2CHO, \nand then to propanoic acid, CH3CH2COOH.\n\t\n\u0007a\t \u0007What reagents and conditions should be used to \noxidise propan-1-ol to propanal?\n\t\n\u0007b\t \u0007Write a balanced chemical equation for this \noxidation.

When a nitrile is refluxed with dilute \nhydrochloric acid hydrolysis occurs, and the \n  C     N \ngroup at the end of the hydrocarbon chain is converted to \nthe \n COOH group, forming a carboxylic acid (see page \n237). For example:\n231\nCH3CH2CN + HCl + 2H2O \n CH3CH2COOH + NH4Cl\n\t propanenitrile\t\npropanoic acid\nReacting as acids\nCarboxylic acids are described as weak acids because \ntheir molecules do not dissociate (ionise) completely \nwhen added to water. However a small proportion of the \nmolecules do dissociate, releasing the H+(aq) ions that \ncharacterise all acidic solutions with a pH value less than 7. \nFor example, ethanoic acid forms aqueous hydrogen ions \nand ethanoate ions in water:\nCH3COOH(aq)  \n  CH3COO–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n\t\nethanoic acid\t\nethanoate ion\nYou can learn more about the dissociation of carboxylic \nacids in Chapter 26 (pages 394–5).\nThe presence of H+(aq) ions in solutions of carboxylic \nacids means that they undergo all the usual reactions of \nacids.

Dry ether is used because LiAlH4 reacts \nviolently with water.\nIn the simplified reduction equation, the symbol [H] \ncan be used to represent the hydrogen atoms from the \nreducing agent (remember that in organic chemistry, \nreduction can be thought of as the addition of hydrogen \natoms).

To make the aldehyde, the \nprimary alcohol is heated gently with acidified \ndichromate solution. The reaction mixture turns \ngreen as the orange dichromate ions, Cr2O7\n2–(aq), \nare reduced to green Cr3+(aq) ions.\nThe oxidising agent is added one drop at a time to \nthe warm alcohol. The aldehyde made needs to \nbe distilled off as it forms in the reaction vessel. \nThis can be done because the aldehyde product \nwill always have a lower boiling point than its \ncorresponding alcohol.

To produce a ketone, this oxidising \nagent must be heated with a secondary alcohol.

However, the attack is by a nucleophile, not \nan electrophile. We can show this using the nucleophilic \naddition reaction of propanal with HCN.

If an aldehyde or ketone is present, a \ndeep-orange precipitate is formed (Figure 18.3).\nFigure 18.3  The orange precipitate formed from  \n2,4-DNPH in a test with propanone, a ketone.\nThe structure of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is:\nNO2\nNH2\nO2N\nN\nH\nThe precipitate formed can be purified by \nrecrystallisation and its melting point can be \nmeasured experimentally. The identity of the \ncompound that precipitated out can then be found by \nreferring to melting point data. From this, the specific \naldehyde or ketone used in the test can be identified.\nThe reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with \n2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is an example of a \ncondensation reaction. In a condensation reaction, two \nmolecules join together and in the process eliminate a \nsmall molecule, in this case water.

The silver ions, \nAg+, in the solution act as a mild oxidising agent. When \nwarmed, the Ag+ ions will oxidise an aldehyde to form a \ncarboxylate ion.\nUnder alkaline conditions any carboxylic acid  \nformed is immediately neutralised to the carboxylate \nion,  COO–, as H+ is removed from  COOH and a  \nsalt is formed.\nIn the redox reaction with an aldehyde, the Ag+ ions \nthemselves are reduced to silver atoms. The silver \natoms form a ‘mirror’ on the inside of the tube, giving a \npositive test for an aldehyde (Figure 18.4).\nThere will be no change observed when a ketone is \nwarmed with Tollens’ reagent as no redox reaction takes \nplace. It remains a colourless mixture in the test tube.\nTesting with Fehling’s solution\nFehling’s solution is an alkaline solution containing \ncopper(II) ions. When warmed with an aldehyde, the Cu2+ \nions act as an oxidising agent. The aldehyde is oxidised to \na carboxylate ion while the Cu2+ ions are reduced to Cu+ \nions. The clear blue Fehling’s solution turns an opaque \nred/orange colour as a precipitate of copper(I) oxide forms \nthroughout the solution (Figure 18.5).\nOnce again, ketones are not oxidised, so the Fehling’s \nsolution remains blue when warmed.\n\nChapter 18: Carbonyl compounds\nOther classes of organic compound that also contain the \ncarbonyl group (such as carboxylic acids and esters) do not \nform precipitates.\nDistinguishing between aldehydes  \nand ketones\nAs we saw on page 236, aldehydes can be further oxidised \nto form carboxylic acids, but ketones cannot be oxidised \neasily. We can use this difference to distinguish between \nan aldehyde and a ketone in simple chemical tests. The two \ntests most commonly used involve Tollens’ reagent and \nFehling’s solution.\n239\nFigure 18.4  The ‘before’ and ‘after’ observations  \nwhen Tollens’ reagent is warmed with an aldehyde,  \nsuch as ethanal.\nFigure 18.5  The ‘before’ and \n‘after’ observations when \nFehling’s solution is warmed with \nan aldehyde, such as ethanal.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n5\t \u0007The melting points of the derivatives of the reaction \nbetween 2,4-DNPH and various aldehydes and ketones \nare shown in the table.\nProduct of reaction \nbetween 2,4-DNPH and ...\nMelting point / °C\nethanal \n168\npropanal \n155\nbutanal \n126\npropanone \n126\nbutanone \n116\n\u0007a\t \u0007What would be observed when each of the \ncarbonyl compounds in the table is mixed with  \n2,4-DNPH?\n\u0007b\t \u0007A derivative was formed between 2,4-DNPH and an \nunknown carbonyl compound.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007The melting point of the derivative was 126 °C. \nWhat does this result tell you?\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007The unknown carbonyl compound formed an \norange precipitate when warmed with Fehling’s \nsolution.

The machine used \nis called a spectrophotometer, and it detects the intensity \nof the wavelengths of infra-red radiation that passes \nthrough the sample.\nThis analytical technique is particularly useful for \norganic chemists because all organic molecules absorb \nradiation in the infra-red range of wavelengths. The energy \nabsorbed corresponds to changes in the vibration of the \nbonds between atoms. The bonds can vibrate by stretching, \nbending and twisting. They have a natural frequency at \nwhich they vibrate. If we irradiate the molecules with \nenergy that corresponds to this frequency, it stimulates \nlarger vibrations and energy is absorbed. This is called the \nresonance frequency of that vibration. \nEach type of vibration will absorb characteristic \nwavelengths of infra-red radiation. These are often \nexpressed as the reciprocal of the wavelength in a unit \ncalled wavenumbers (measured in cm–1). We cannot be \ntoo specific when quoting the characteristic absorption \nfrequency of a bond – the nature of the rest of the molecule \nshifts the energy absorbed in each particular molecule. \nHowever, we can say, for example, that the amine group  \n(\n NH2) absorbs in the range 3300 to 3500 cm–1.\nTherefore we can identify the presence (or absence) of \ndifferent functional groups from the absorbance pattern \non an infra-red spectrum.

For example, \nwe might want to investigate a precipitation reaction \nto find out how the concentration of a reactant affects \nthe rate at which the precipitate forms. You might have \nseen the reaction between sodium thiosulfate and dilute \nhydrochloric acid, which is a commonly investigated \nprecipitation reaction. Sulfur is the precipitate formed:\nNa2S2O3(aq)  +  2HCl(aq)\n2NaCl(aq)  +  S(s)  +  H2O(l)  +  SO2(g)\nThis type of investigation involves changing only the \nvariable under investigation (in this case the concentration \nof a reactant) and keeping all other relevant variables \nconstant. We can judge the effect of changing the \nconcentration by devising a way to measure how quickly \nthe precipitate forms, such as timing how long it takes for \nthe solution to become opaque.\nWe now have the question we are investigating and the \nstructure of the investigation in terms of its key variables:\nIn a precipitation reaction, how does the concentration of \na reactant affect the rate of precipitation (as measured by \nthe time it takes for the solution to become opaque)?\n\nPractical skills 1\nFigure P1.1  Chemist performing a titration.\n■\n■\nThe independent variable is the one under investigation, \nwhich is changed systematically and for which we can \nchoose different values (in this case, the concentration  \nof reactant).\n■\n■\nThe dependent variable is the one we measure to judge the \neffect of changing the independent variable (in this case, \nthe time it takes for the solution to become opaque).\n247\n■\n■\nThe control variables are those that we must keep  \nconstant to ensure a fair test is carried out (in this case, \nwe should control the temperature and total volume of \nreactants used).\nNote that we can express the question in this type of \ninvestigation generally as:\nHow does the independent variable affect the dependent \nvariable?\nWhen asked to plan and/or carry out an investigation, it is \nimportant that you state the question under investigation \nclearly and list the independent, dependent and control \nvariables before you start writing down your proposed \nmethod or planning how to record and present your results.\nThe type of variable under investigation will determine \nwhether you display the data collected in a table as a line \ngraph or as a bar chart. To decide which type of graph  \nto draw, you need to know the difference between \ncontinuous variables – which are measured so can have any \nnumerical value within the range of results – and categoric\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nvariables – which are described by words. We can assume \nthat the dependent variable is continuous, as it measures \nthe effect of varying the independent variable. Then if the \nindependent variable is continuous, we draw a line graph. \nIf the independent variable is categoric, we draw a bar \nchart. So if you investigate the effect of temperature on \nrate of reaction, the data can be presented as a line graph, \nwhereas if you investigate the rate of different metals \nreacting with dilute acid, the data can be presented as a bar \nchart (as there are no values between those chosen for the \nindependent variable). See the graphs in Figure P1.2.\nIn the Cambridge International AS and A Level \nAdvanced Practical Skills examination (Paper 3), you will \nneed to follow instructions to carry out an investigation \ninto an unknown substance or mixture of substances. \nAlways read through all of the instructions before carrying \nout the tests. Testing for unknown substances will require \nyou to describe your observations in detail. You will be able \nto refer to tables of tests for cations, anions and gases in the \nQualitative Analysis Notes in your examination paper (see \nAppendix 3, page 475) to draw your conclusions.\nYou will also carry out a quantitative task (based on \nmeasurements) rather than a qualitative task (based on \nobservations). Examples of problems that need you to \ncollect quantitative data could be a titration (a volumetric \nanalysis) or an enthalpy change experiment. This type \nof task will require you to read scales on measuring \ninstruments such as burettes, measuring cylinders, gas \nsyringes and balances. For instruments with an analogue \nscale, such as a burette, you should be able to read \nmeasurements to within half the value of the fine line \ndivisions on the scale. So a burette with fine line divisions \nevery 0.10 cm3 should be read to the nearest 0.05 cm3.

Generally, the independent variable goes in the first \ncolumn and the dependent variable goes in the second \ncolumn. Sometimes, if space on the page is an issue, a table \ncan be organised horizontally. In this case, the independent \nvariable again goes first but at the start of the first row in \nthe table, with the dependent variable beneath it, not next \nto it as in a conventional table.\n■\n■\nWhen recording quantitative data you will often need \ncolumns for repeat results and calculations of the mean. This \nis achieved by subdividing the column for the dependent \nvariable into the required number of columns. For example, \nin the rate of precipitation investigation described at the \nbeginning of this chapter, the table to record three repeat \nreadings and their means would be organised as:\nConcentration / \nmol dm–3\nTime for reaction mixture to turn \nopaque / s\n1st test\n2nd test\n3rd test\nMean\n■\n■\nNote that the headings in the table have their units included \n– therefore you do not need to record the units for each \nentry you make in the table.\n■\n■\nOn graphs, always plot the independent variable along \nthe horizontal (x) axis and the dependent variable up the \nvertical (y) axis.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n■\n■\nDraw the lines in tables and graphs in pencil, labelling the \naxes as in the corresponding table headings with their units.\n■\n■\nIn the table above, there could be an extra column on the \nright-hand side for values of the reciprocal of the mean  \ntime taken for the reaction mixture to become opaque \n(headed ‘1 / time’). This could be plotted on a graph of  \n1/time against concentration to see how the rate of reaction \nvaries with temperature (as rate is proportional to 1/time, \nso the greater the time, the slower the rate). See the graphs \nin Figure P1.4.\n■\n■\nThe labelled axes must be longer than half the size of the \ngraph grid in both directions, selecting a sensible scale (e.g. \n1, 2 or 5 units per 20 mm square on the grid – not 3 units).\n■\n■\nThe points should be plotted as small, neat x’s with a sharp \npencil. The line drawn through the points should not be \n‘dot-to-dot’ but should be a line of best fit – either drawn \nwith a ruler for a straight line or a smooth free-hand line for \na curve.

Then construct a right-angled \ntriangle, as shown in Figure P1.5. The gradient tells us \nthe rate of change of y (the dependent variable) per unit \nchange of x (the independent variable):\ngradient = ​ change in y \n__________ \nchange in x ​\nWhen evaluating the quality of the data collected, there \nare two types of error to consider: random errors and \nsystematic errors. Whenever we carry out an experiment \nthere are always errors involved. They might be due to \nthe experimenter not reading the scale on a measuring \ninstrument correctly or choosing a measuring instrument \nwith an inappropriate scale. These examples of human \nerror could equally make the values of data too high or \ntoo low, so they are called random errors. Repeating tests \nand taking the mean value helps to reduce the effect of \nrandom errors.\nHowever, other errors can result in consistently high \nor low values being recorded. These are called systematic \nerrors. Examples would be reading the volume of liquid\n\nread values\nfrom the y-axis\ny\nchange in y\nchange in x\nx\nread values\nfrom the x-axis\nFigure P1.5  Finding the gradient of a straight-line graph. \nChoosing to construct a large triangle reduces the percentage \nerror in the values read from the axes, which are then used to \ncalculate the gradient.\nin a burette to the upper level of the liquid instead of to \nthe bottom of the meniscus. It should noted though that \nthese consistently high measurements of volume would \nnot result in an incorrect value for the titre, because the \nfinal volume is subtracted from the initial volume. Not \nensuring the measuring instrument is correctly set on \nzero is another example of a systematic error, which if not \ncorrected during an investigation can result in consistently \nhigh or low masses being measured on balances.\nOther systematic errors can be caused by errors when \nplanning an investigation. This might result in data being \ncollected that does not really answer the question under \ninvestigation. For example, a control variable might not \nbe kept constant or taken into account, or the dependent \nvariable chosen might not be a true measure of the effect \nof varying the independent variable. Such error will make \nthe data collected invalid.\nYou will have to estimate the error inherent in reading \nscales, as described at the beginning of this chapter, and \nthe evaluation is the place to discuss the effect these \nmeasurement errors might have on the validity of the data \nand conclusions you can draw from them. In the example \nof a thermometer with 1 °C calibration marks, you can \nquote values to the nearest 0.5 °C. The actual effect of this \nmargin of error on confidence levels will depend on the \nmagnitude of the temperature being measured. When \nreading a low temperature of, say, 5.0 °C, plus or minus\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n0.5 °C will have a bigger effect than when reading a higher \ntemperature, such as 92.5 °C. For this reason it is best to \nquote percentage errors, worked out using the equation:\npercentage error = ​ \nmargin of error \n \n________________________ \n \n \nactual or mean measurement ​ × 100%\nworked example\nIn the case of the two temperatures 5 °C and 92.5 °C, for \n5 °C the percentage error will be:\n​ 0.5 × 100 \n________ \n5 \n​ = 10%\nwhereas for 92.5 °C the percentage error is:\n​ 0.5 × 100 \n________ \n92.5  ​ = 0.54%\nSo there is a significant error in reading 5 °C compared \nwith reading 92.5 °C.\nIn enthalpy change investigations you often have to \nmeasure temperature differences, subtracting the final \ntemperature from the initial temperature. In this case, \nusing the thermometer just described, the error would \nbe plus or minus 1 °C, as the two 0.5 °C margins of error \nshould be added together. In this case you should suggest \nincreasing the temperature change. For example, when \nevaluating enthalpies of combustion of alcohols by heating \nwater in a copper calorimeter, you could use a smaller \nvolume of water to heat. However, this change would have \nto be balanced against the increase in percentage error in \nmeasuring the smaller volume of water, to see which gives \nthe least percentage error overall.\nYou might need to suggest how to make your data \nmore accurate. For example, in the rate of precipitation \ninvestigation you could improve the accuracy of judging \nthe time when the reaction reaches a certain point in each \ntest carried out. Whereas judging the moment when a \npencil mark can no longer be seen through the reaction \nmixture is subjective, you could use a light source and \nlightmeter to make more objective judgements. You could \nstop the timer when the level of light passing through the \nreaction mixture drops to the same level as measured by \nthe lightmeter in each test. This will make your repeat (or \nreplicate) data more precise and improve the accuracy of \nyour results.\nYour evaluation might lead beyond suggestions to \nchange the method to ideas to investigate new questions. \nFor example, evaluating the rate of precipitation, you will \nhave tried to control the temperature – probably by ensuring \nboth solutions started mixing at the same temperature. \nHowever, if the reaction is exothermic, this might cause the\n\nPractical skills 1\ntemperature to change between the different concentrations \ninvestigated. This could lead to a new investigation to \ncompare the energy transferred in a precipitation reaction at \ndifferent concentrations. The question could be phrased as \n‘How does the concentration of a reactant solution affect the \nenergy transferred in the reaction?’.\nWhen drawing conclusions from investigations \ninvolving the manipulation of variables, you should refer to \nyour graph when commenting on the relationship between \nthe independent and dependent variables, explaining your \nfindings using the data and your scientific knowledge and \nunderstanding. When drawing conclusions from qualitative \ntests to identify an unknown substance, where possible try \nto carry out or suggest a further confirmatory test for the \nsame substance from the table provided in Paper 3.\nAny hypotheses you were testing can only be refuted \n(disproved) by a practical investigation you carry out; \nthey cannot be proved because of the limitations of your \ninvestigation. So hypotheses can only be ‘supported’ by \nthe data collected. If your hypothesis predicts that the rate \nof reaction increases with increasing concentration, with \na justification using collision theory, and data from your \ninvestigation supports this, you cannot say whether this \nrelationship is true beyond the range of concentrations \ntested. There might be a point at higher concentrations \nwhere increasing the concentration of one reactant \nwill start to have less, or even no, effect because there \nis such excess that the rate of collisions with the other \nreactant particles is not affected by further increases of \nconcentration – so this would give you another idea to test!\n253\nquestion\n4\t \u0007a\t \u0007A student measured the average rate of a reaction \nby timing how long it took to collect 20 cm3 of the \ngas liberated in the reaction.

In this \nchapter we show how we can use enthalpy changes \nto calculate the strength of ionic bonding, and \nexplain differences in solubility and ease of thermal \ndecomposition of ionic compounds.\nFigure 19.1  A model of the sodium chloride lattice. The \nenergy released when gaseous ions combine to form a lattice \nis called the lattice energy.\nDefining lattice energy\nWhen ions combine to form an ionic solid there is a huge \nrelease of energy. The reaction is highly exothermic. The \nenergy given out when ions of opposite charges come together \nto form a crystalline lattice is called the lattice energy, ΔH \nO\n—\nlatt.\nEquations describing the lattice energy of sodium \nchloride and magnesium chloride are shown here.\n258\nLattice energy is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of an \nionic compound is formed from its gaseous ions under \nstandard conditions.\nNa+(g) + Cl–(g)  \n  NaCl(s)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nlatt = –787 kJ mol–1\nMg2+(g) + 2Cl–(g)  \n  MgCl2(s)\b ΔH \nO\n—\nlatt = –2526 kJ mol–1\nNote that:\n■\n■\nit is the gaseous ions that combine to form the ionic solid\n■\n■\nthe lattice energy is always exothermic: the value of  \nΔH O\n—\nlatt is always negative, because the definition specifies \nthe bonding together of ions, not the separation of ions.\nThe large exothermic value of the lattice energy shows that \nthe ionic lattice is very stable with respect to its gaseous \nions. The more exothermic the lattice energy, the stronger \nthe ionic bonding in the lattice.\nIt is impossible to determine the lattice energy of a \ncompound by a single direct experiment. We can, however, \ncalculate a value for ΔH \nO\n—\nlatt using several experimental \nvalues and an energy cycle called a Born–Haber cycle. In \norder to do this, we first need to introduce two more types \nof enthalpy change.\n\nNote that the quantity we have defined as lattice energy \nis more accurately called the lattice enthalpy. However, \nthe term lattice energy is commonly applied to lattice \nenthalpy as well. Lattice energy is the internal energy \nchange when 1 mole of an ionic compound is formed from \nits gaseous ions at 0 K. Lattice enthalpy values are very \nclose to the corresponding lattice energy values.\nQuestion\n1\t a\t \u0007Give values for the standard conditions of \ntemperature and pressure.\nb\t Write equations describing the lattice energy of:\ni\t\nmagnesium oxide\nii\t potassium bromide\niii\t sodium sulfide.\nEnthalpy change of atomisation \nand electron affinity\nEnthalpy change of atomisation\nThe standard enthalpy change of atomisation, ΔH O\n—\nat, is \nthe enthalpy change when 1 mole of gaseous atoms is \nformed from its element under standard conditions.\nThe standard enthalpy change of atomisation of lithium \nrelates to the equation:\nLi(s)  \n  Li(g)\t\nΔH \nO\n—\nat  = +161 kJ mol–1\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of atomisation of chlorine \nrelates to the equation:\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2(g)  \n  Cl(g)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nat = +122 kJ mol–1\nValues of ΔH \nO\n—\nat are always positive (endothermic) because \nenergy must be supplied to break the bonds holding the \natoms in the element together.\nQuestion\n2\t a\t \u0007The bond energy of the chlorine molecule is \n+244 kJ mol–1.

Explain your answer.\nElectron affinity\nThe energy change occurring when a gaseous non-metal \natom accepts one electron is called the electron affinity. \nThe symbol for electron affinity is ΔH \nO\n—\nea.\nThe first electron affinity, ΔH O\n—\nea1, is the enthalpy change\nwhen 1 mole of electrons is added to 1 mole of  \ngaseous atoms to form 1 mole of gaseous 1– ions under \nstandard conditions.\nEquations representing the first electron affinity of \nchlorine and sulfur are:\nCl(g)  +  e–  \n  Cl–(g)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nea1 = –348 kJ mol–1\nS(g)  +  e–  \n  S–(g)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nea1 = –200 kJ mol–1\nNote that:\n■\n■\nthe change is from gaseous atoms to gaseous 1– ions\n■\n■\nthe enthalpy change for the first electron affinity, ΔH O\n—\nea1 is \ngenerally exothermic: ΔH O\n—\nea is negative.\nWhen an element forms an ion with more than one \nnegative charge, we must use successive electron affinities \n(this is rather like the successive ionisation energies we \nused on page 34). The 1st, 2nd and 3rd electron affinities \nhave symbols ΔH \nO\n—\nea1, ΔH \nO\n—\nea2 and ΔH \nO\n—\nea3.\n\nChapter 19: Lattice energy\nThe second electron affinity, ΔH O\n—\nea2, is the enthalpy \nchange when 1 mole of electrons is added to 1 mole of \ngaseous 1– ions to form 1 mole of gaseous 2– ions under \nstandard conditions.\nThe equations representing the 1st and 2nd electron \naffinities of oxygen are:\n1st electron affinity: \nO(g)  +  e–  \n  O–(g) ΔH \nO\n—\nea1 = –141 kJ mol–1\n2nd electron affinity: \nO–(g)  +  e–  \n  O2–(g) ΔH \nO\n—\nea2 = +798 kJ mol–1\nNote that 2nd electron affinities are always endothermic \n(ΔH \nO\n—\nea2 is positive), and so are 3rd electron affinities.\nThe overall enthalpy change in forming an oxide ion, \nO2–, from an oxygen atom is found by adding together the \n1st and 2nd electron affinities:\nO(g)  +  2e–  \n  O2–(g)\nΔH \nO\n—\nea1  +  ΔH \nO\n—\nea2 = (–141)  +  (+798) = +657 kJ mol–1\n259\nQuestion\n3\t a\t \u0007Suggest why the 2nd and 3rd electron affinities are \nalways endothermic.\nb\t \u0007The 1st electron affinity of sulfur is –200 kJ mol–1. \nThe second electron affinity of sulfur is \n+640 kJ mol–1.

The size and charge of these ions can \naffect the value of the lattice energy.\nLattice energy and ion size\nAs the size of the ion increases, the lattice energy becomes \nless exothermic. This applies to both anions and cations. \nFigure 19.6 shows that:\n■\n■\nfor any given anion, e.g. F –, the lattice energy gets less \nexothermic as the size of the cation increases from Li+ to Cs+\n■\n■\nfor any given cation, e.g. Li+, the lattice energy gets less \nexothermic as the size of the anion increases from F– to I–.\n–1100\nLi+\n–1000\nLattice enthalpy/ kJmol–1\nNa+\n–900\nRb+\nK+\n–800\nCs+\n–700\n–600\nCl–\nBr–\nI–\nF–\n0\n.\nFigure 19.6  Lattice enthalpies of the Group 1 halides.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nIons with the same ionic charge have a lower charge density \nif their radius is larger. This is because the same charge is \nspread out over a larger volume. A lower charge density \nresults in weaker electrostatic forces of attraction in the \nionic lattice. Sodium fluoride has a less exothermic lattice \nenergy than lithium fluoride. This reflects the lower charge \ndensity on sodium ions compared with lithium ions.\nLattice energy and charge on the ions\nThe lattice energy becomes more exothermic as the ionic \ncharge increases.\nWe can see this by comparing lithium fluoride, LiF, \nwith magnesium oxide, MgO. These compounds have the \nsame arrangement of ions in their lattice structure. The \ncations Li+ and Mg2+ have similar sizes. The anions F – \nand O2– are fairly similar in size (although they are much \nlarger than the cations). The major physical difference \nbetween LiF and MgO is the ionic charge. This affects the \nlattice energy:\nΔH \nO\n—\nlatt [LiF] = –1049 kJ mol–1\nΔH \nO\n—\nlatt [MgO] = –3923 kJ mol–1\nMagnesium oxide has a greater lattice energy than \nlithium fluoride. The doubly charged Mg2+ and O2– ions \nin magnesium oxide attract each other more strongly  \nthan the singly charged ions of the same size in LiF. \nFor ions of similar size, the greater the ionic charge, the \nhigher the charge density. This results in stronger ionic \nbonds being formed.\nquestions\n8\t a\t \u0007For each pair of compounds, suggest which will have \nthe most exothermic lattice energy.\ni\t\nKCl and BaO (ionic radii are similar)\nii\t MgI2 and SrI2\n\t\n\t\niii\t CaO and NaCl (ionic radii are similar).\nb\t \u0007Place the following compounds in order of \nincreasingly exothermic lattice energy.

This is not always the \ncase. In some cases, the positive charge on the cation in an \nionic lattice may attract the electrons in the anion towards \nit. This results in a distortion of the electron cloud of the \nanion and the anion is no longer spherical (Figure 19.7). \nWe call this distortion ion polarisation. The ability of a \ncation to attract electrons and distort an anion is called \nthe polarising power of the cation.\n2+\n–\n263\nFigure 19.7  Ion polarisation. A small highly charged cation \ncan distort the shape of the anion.\nFactors affecting ion polarisation\nThe degree of polarisation of an anion depends on:\n■\n■\nthe charge density of the cation\n■\n■\nthe ease with which the anion can be polarised  \n– its polarisability.\nAn anion is more likely to be polarised if:\n■\n■\nthe cation is small\n■\n■\nthe cation has a charge of 2+ or 3+\n■\n■\nthe anion is large\n■\n■\nthe anion has a charge of 2– or 3–.\nA small highly charged cation such as Fe3+ can attract \nelectrons and distort a larger anion to such an extent \nthat the bond formed has a considerable amount of \ncovalent character. Pure ionic bonding and pure covalent \nbonding are extremes. Many ionic compounds have some \ncovalent character due to ion polarisation. Many covalent \ncompounds have some degree of charge separation, i.e. \nthey are polar, due to bond polarisation (see Chapter 4, \npages 60–61).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n10\t a\t \u0007Explain why a cation with a smaller ionic radius \nhas a higher charge density.\nb\t \u0007Which one of the following ions will be the  \nbest polariser of the large nitrate ion?

No metallic salts are absolutely insoluble in water. \nEven lead carbonate, which is regarded as insoluble, \ndissolves to a very small extent: 0.000 17 g dissolves in \nevery dm3 of water. If salts were completely insoluble they \ncould not have a value for ΔH \nO\n—\nsol.\n265\nEnthalpy change of hydration\nThe lattice energy for sodium chloride is –788 kJ mol–1. \nThis means that we need to supply (at least) +788 kJ mol–1 \nto overcome the forces of attraction between the ions. But \nΔH \nO\n—\nsol [NaCl] is only +3.9 kJ mol–1. Where does the energy \nneeded to separate the ions come from? The answer is that \nit comes from the strong attraction between the ions and \nthe water molecules.\nWhen an ionic solid dissolves in water, bonds are \nformed between water molecules and the ions. These \nbonds are called ion–dipole bonds. Water is a polar \nmolecule. The δ– oxygen atoms in water molecules are \nattracted to the positive ions in the ionic compound.

For example, \nwhen a copper rod is placed in contact with an aqueous \nsolution of its ions the following equilibrium exists:\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Cu(s)\nThere are two opposing reactions in this equilibrium.\n■\n■\nMetal atoms from the rod entering the solution as metal \nions. This leaves electrons behind on the surface of the rod. \nFor example:\nCu(s)  \n  Cu2+(aq)  +  2e–\n■\n■\nIons in solution accepting electrons from the metal rod and \nbeing deposited as metal atoms on the surface of the rod. \nFor example:\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Cu(s)\nThe redox equilibrium is established when the rate of \nelectron gain equals the rate of electron loss.\nFor unreactive metals such as copper, if this \nequilibrium is compared with the equilibrium set up by \nother metals, the equilibrium set up by copper lies further \nover to the right.\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Cu(s)\nCu2+(aq) ions are therefore relatively easy to reduce. They \ngain electrons readily to form copper metal.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nFor reactive metals such as vanadium, the equilibrium \nlies further over to the left.\nV2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  V(s)\nV2+(aq) ions are therefore relatively difficult to reduce. \nThey gain electrons much less readily by comparison.\nThe position of equilibrium differs for different \ncombinations of metals placed in solutions of their ions.\nWhen a metal is put into a solution of its ions an electric \npotential (voltage) is established between the metal and the \nmetal ions in solution. We cannot measure this potential \ndirectly. But we can measure the difference in potential \nbetween the metal/metal ion system and another system. We \ncall this value the electrode potential, E. Electrode potential \nis measured in volts. The system we use for comparison is the \nstandard hydrogen electrode.\nIt is thought that the absolute electrical potentials \nthat we cannot measure are caused by the formation of \nan electrical double layer when an element is placed in a \nsolution of its ions. For example, when zinc is placed in a \nsolution containing zinc ions, a tiny number of zinc atoms \non the surface of the metal are converted to zinc ions, \nwhich go into solution. This leaves an excess of electrons \non the surface of the zinc. The solution around the metal \nnow has excess Zn2+ ions. Some of these cations near \nthe surface of the zinc are attracted to its surface. So an \nelectrical double layer is formed. This build up of charge \ncauses an electric potential (voltage) between the metal \nand the metal ions in solution (Figure 20.4).\n2+ = Zn2+ ions\nzinc rod\nZnSO4(aq)\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\nFigure 20.4  The separation of charge when a zinc rod is \nplaced in a solution of Zn2+ ions results in an electrical  \ndouble layer.\n\nChapter 20: Electrochemistry\nThe standard hydrogen electrode\nThe standard hydrogen electrode is one of several \ntypes of half-cell that can be used as reference \nelectrodes.

The standard electrode \npotentials for the halogens are:\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ F2  +  e–  \n  F–\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +2.87 V\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2  +  e–  \n  Cl–\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.36 V\n290\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Br2  +  e–  \n  Br–\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.07 V\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ I2  +  e–  \n  I–\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.54 V\nBased on these E \nO\n—\n    values, as we go down Group 17 from F2 \nto I2, the oxidising ability of the halogen decreases and the \nability of halide ions to act as reducing agents increases.\nFigure 20.22  Aqueous chlorine displaces bromine from a \nsolution of potassium bromide. We can use E O\n—\n     values to \nexplain why a halogen higher in Group 17 displaces a halogen \nlower in the group from a solution of its halide ions.\n\nquestions\n24\t Use the E O\n—\n     values for the halogens (see page 474) to \nexplain the following:\na\t \u0007Why bromine can oxidise an aqueous solution of \niodide ions.\nb\t \u0007Why bromine does not react with chloride ions.\n25\t Use the data in Appendix 2 (page 474) to answer  \nthese questions.\na\t \u0007Of the ions Ag+, Cr2+ and Fe2+, which one needs  \nthe strongest reducing agent to reduce it to  \nmetal atoms?\nb\t \u0007Of the atoms Ag, Cr and Fe, which one needs the \nstrongest oxidising agent to oxidise it to an ion?\nHow does the value of E O\n— vary with ion \nconcentration?\nIn Chapter 8 (pages 119–123) we saw that the position \nof an equilibrium reaction is affected by changes \nin concentration, temperature and pressure. Redox \nequilibria are no different. When we compare the voltage \nof a standard half-cell, X, with a standard hydrogen \nelectrode, we are measuring E \nO\n—\n    for the half-cell X. If we \nchange the concentration or temperature of half-cell X, \nthe electrode potential also changes. Under these non-\nstandard conditions we use the symbol E for the  \nelectrode potential.\nWhat happens to the electrode potential when we \nchange the concentration of ions in a half-cell? Let us take \nan example of a metal/metal ion equilibrium:\nZn2+(aq)  +  e–  \n  Zn(s)\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = –0.76 V\n■\n■\nIf [Zn2+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm–3, the value of E \nbecomes less negative / more positive (for example −0.61 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Zn2+] is less than 1.00 mol dm–3, the value of E becomes more \nnegative / less positive (for example −0.80 V).\nWe can apply Le Chatelier’s principle to redox equilibria.  \nIf we increase the concentration of the species on the  \nleft of the equation, the position of equilibrium will  \nshift to the right. So the value of E becomes more positive / \nless negative.\nIf two different ions are present in the half-cell, we have \nto consider both ions.\nLet us take the equilibrium between Fe3+ ions and Fe2+ \nions as an example.\nFe3+  +  e–  \n  Fe2+\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.77 V\n1.00 mol dm–3\t\n1.00 mol dm–3\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n■\n■\nIf [Fe3+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm –3  \n(keeping [Fe2+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes \nmore positive (for example +0.85 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Fe3+] is less than 1.00 mol dm–3  \n(keeping [Fe2+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes less \npositive (for example +0.70 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Fe2+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm–3  \n(keeping [Fe3+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes less \npositive (for example +0.70 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Fe2+] is less than 1.00 mol dm–3  \n(keeping [Fe3+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes \nmore positive (for example +0.85 V).\nYou can see from the above that if we increase the \nconcentration of both the Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions, these effects \nmay cancel each other out.\nHow can we predict whether or not a given reaction \nwill occur under non-standard conditions? The answer \nis that if the E \nO\n—\n    values of the two half-reactions involved \ndiffer by more than 0.30 V, then the reaction predicted by \nthe E \nO\n—\n    values is highly likely to occur. So chlorine is likely \nto oxidise Fe2+ ions even if the conditions are not standard. \nThis is because the difference in their E \nO\n—\n    values is 0.59 V, \nwhich is considerably greater than 0.30 V.\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2(g)  +  e–  \n  Cl– (aq)\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.36 V\nFe3+(aq)  +  e–  \n  Fe2+(aq)\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.77 V\nWe cannot, however, predict with confidence whether the \nreaction between MnO4\n– ions and Cl2 will take place if the \nconditions are too far from standard.\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–  \n  Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.52 V\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2(g)  +  e–  \n  Cl–(aq)\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.36 V\nThis is because the difference in E \nO\n—\n    values is 0.16 V, which \nis considerably smaller than 0.30 V.\nThe figure 0.30 V given here to enable us to tell if a \nreaction will still occur under non-standard conditions is a \nrough guide only.

Many cells \nare small but they do not necessarily produce a high voltage \nfor a long time. Batteries of several cells joined together give \na higher voltage but take up more space.

In these cells the redox reactions \ncontinue until the reactants reach a low concentration and \nthe voltage of the cell declines. The cell is then no longer \nof any use. Some electrochemical cells can be recharged \nby passing an electric current through them. The products \nare then changed back to reactants so the cell can function \nagain.

A buffer solution is used to keep pH \n(almost) constant.\nOne type of buffer solution is a mixture of a weak acid \nand one of its salts. An example is an aqueous mixture of \nethanoic acid and sodium ethanoate. Mixtures of ethanoic \nacid and sodium ethanoate in different proportions act as \nbuffers between pH values of 4 and 7. We can understand \nhow a buffer solution works by referring to the equilibria \ninvolved.\nEthanoic acid is a weak acid. So it stays mostly in the \nun-ionised form (CH3COOH) and only gives rise to a low \nconcentration of ethanoate ions in solution:\nCH3COOH(aq)  \n  H+(aq)  +  CH3COO–(aq)\nethanoic acid\t\nethanoate ion\n\nChapter 21: Further aspects of equilibria\nFigure 21.12  The pH of this agar plate for growing bacteria is \nkept constant by using a buffer solution. The buffer solution is \nincorporated in the agar jelly used to make the plate.\nSodium ethanoate is fully ionised in aqueous solution:\nCH3COONa(s)  +  aq  \n  Na+(aq)  +  CH3COO–(aq)\nsodium ethanoate\t\nethanoate ion\nThe buffer solution contains relatively high concentrations \nof both CH3COOH and CH3COO–. We say that there are \nreserve supplies of the acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate \nbase (CH3COO–). The pH of a buffer solution depends \non the ratio of the concentration of the acid and the \nconcentration of its conjugate base. If this does not change \nvery much, the pH changes very little.\nIn the buffer solution ethanoic acid molecules are in \nequilibrium with hydrogen ions and ethanoate ions:\n313\nCH3COOH(aq)  \n  H+(aq)  +  CH3COO–(aq)\nrelatively high\t\nrelatively high \n\t\nconcentration\t\nconcentration \n\t\nof ethanoic acid\t\nof ethanoate ions\nWe can use this equation to explain how buffer  \nsolutions work.\nAn increase in hydrogen ion concentration would \ngreatly lower the pH of water, but when H+ ions are added \nto the buffer solution:\n■\n■\naddition of H+ ions shifts the position of equilibrium to the \nleft because H+ ions combine with CH3COO– ions to form more \nCH3COOH until equilibrium is re-established\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COO– ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COO– ions in solution does not  \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COOH ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COOH molecules in solution does not \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nso the pH does not change significantly.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nAn increase in hydroxide ion concentration would greatly \nincrease the pH of water, but when OH– ions are added to \nthe buffer solution:\n■\n■\nthe added OH– ions combine with H+ ions to form water\n■\n■\nthis reduces the H+ ion concentration\n■\n■\nthe position of equilibrium shifts to the right\n■\n■\nso CH3COOH molecules ionise to form more H+ and \nCH3COO– ions until equilibrium is re-established\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COOH ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COOH molecules in solution does not \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COO– ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COO– ions in solution does not  \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nso the pH does not change significantly.\nIn unpolluted regions of the Earth, rainwater has a pH \nof 5.7. This is because carbon dioxide dissolves in the \nrainwater to form a dilute solution of the weak acid \ncarbonic acid, H2CO3. This acid and its conjugate base, \nHCO3\n–, act as a buffer solution. It minimises changes in \npH if very small amounts of acid or alkali are added to the \nrainwater. But in regions where there is pollution caused \nby the emission of acidic oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, the \npH of the rainwater falls to around 4. The rainwater can \nno longer act as a buffer because the concentrations of the \nH2CO3 and HCO3\n– are not high enough to cope with the \nlarge amounts of acidic pollution involved.\nNo buffer solution can cope with the excessive addition \nof acids or alkalis. If very large amounts of acid or alkali \nare added, the pH will change significantly.\nBuffer solutions that resist changes in pH in alkaline \nregions are usually a mixture of a weak base and its \nconjugate acid. An example is a mixture of aqueous \nammonia with ammonium chloride.\nAqueous ammonia is a weak base, so there is only a low \nconcentration of ammonium ions in ammonia solution:\n314\nNH3(aq)  +  H2O(l)   \n   NH4\n+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nAmmonium chloride is fully ionised in aqueous  \nsolution.

They are also used to \nmake sure that pH meters record the correct pH.\nMany animals depend on buffers to keep a constant \npH in various parts of their bodies. In humans, the pH \nof the blood is kept between 7.35 and 7.45 by a number of \ndifferent buffers in the blood:\n■\n■\nhydrogencarbonate ions, HCO3\n–\n■\n■\nhaemoglobin and plasma proteins\n■\n■\ndihydrogenphosphate (H2PO4\n–) and hydrogenphosphate \n(HPO4\n2–) ions.\nThe cells in our body produce carbon dioxide as a product \nof aerobic respiration (the oxidation of glucose to provide \nenergy).

When the blood passes through the small \nblood vessels around our lungs hydrogencarbonate ions \nare rapidly converted to carbon dioxide and water. The \ncarbon dioxide escapes into the lungs.\nThe production of H+ ions, if left unchecked, would lower \nthe pH of the blood and cause ‘acidosis’. This may disrupt \nsome body functions and eventually lead to coma.

Some \nionic compounds, however, are insoluble or only slightly \nsoluble in water. But even ‘insoluble’ ionic compounds \nmay dissolve to a very small extent in water. Solubility \nis generally quoted as the number of grams or number \nof moles of compound needed to saturate 100 g or 1 kg \nof water at a given temperature. We say that a solution is \nsaturated when no more solute dissolves in it.\n316\n■\n■\nSodium chloride is regarded as a soluble salt: a saturated \nsolution contains 36 g per 100 g of water.\n■\n■\nLead(II) chloride is regarded as an insoluble salt: a saturated \nsolution contains 0.99 g per 100 g of water.\nSolubility product\nAn equilibrium is established when an undissolved \nionic compound is in contact with a saturated solution \nof its ions.

Values are quoted  \nat 298 K.\nSolubility product is the product of the concentrations \nof each ion in a saturated solution of a sparingly soluble \nsalt at 298 K, raised to the power of their relative \nconcentrations.\nKsp = [Cy+(aq)]a[Ax–(aq)]b\nwhere a is the number of C y+ cations in one formula unit \nof the compound and b is the number of Ax– anions in one \nformula unit of the compound\nSo for Fe2S3 (which contains Fe3+ ions and S2– ions) the \nequilibrium is:\nFe2S3(s)  \n  2Fe3+(aq)  +  3S2–(aq)\nand the equilibrium expression is:\nKsp = [Fe3+(aq)]2[S2–(aq)]3\nThe idea of solubility product only applies to ionic \ncompounds that are only slightly soluble.\nThe units of solubility product depend on the number \nof each type of ion present in solution. You can work \nthe units out in the same way as for general equilibrium \nexpressions (see page 123), but you don’t have to do any \ncancelling.

Some \nexamples are using colorimetry, a conductivity meter \nor measuring changes in gas volume or gas pressure.\nColorimetry can be used to monitor the change in \ncolour of a particular reactant. For example, this \nmethod can be used to follow the reaction of iodine \nwith propanone:\n326\nCH3COCH3  +  I2  \n  CH3COCH2I  +  HI\nAs the reaction proceeds, the colour of the iodine \nfades.\nChanges in electrical conductivity of the solution can \nbe measured.

This method can sometimes \nbe used even if there are ions on both sides of the \nequation. This is due to the fact that ions vary in their \nconductivities. For example the small H+ and OH– \nions have very high conductivities but Br – ions have a \nlow conductivity.\nChanges in gas volume or gas pressure can be \nmeasured.

We can express \nthis mathematically as:\nrate of reaction = k × [cyclopropane]\nThe proportionality constant, k, is called the rate constant.\nThe overall expression (rate of reaction = k × [cyclopropane]) \nis the rate equation for this particular reaction. Rate \nequations are generally written without the × sign.  \nFor example:\nrate = k[cyclopropane]\nRate equations can only be determined from experimental \ndata. They cannot be found from the stoichiometric \nequation.\nSome experimentally determined rate equations are \nshown in Table 22.3.\nYou can see from equation 1 that the rate of reaction \nis proportional to the concentration of both H2 and I2; \nhowever, in equation 2, CO and O2 do not appear in \nthe rate equation, even though they are present in the \nstoichiometric equation. Similarly in reactions 3 and 4 \nthere is no relationship between the rate equation and the \nstoichiometry of the chemical equation.\n330\nStoichiometric equation\nRate equation\n1  H2(g)  +  I2(g)  \n  2HI(g)\nrate = k[H2] [I2]\nNO2(g)  +  CO2(g)\nrate = k[NO]2\n2  NO(g)  +  CO(g)  +  O2(g)\n2H2O(g)  +  N2(g) \nrate = k[H2] [NO]2\n3  2H2(g)  +  2NO(g)\n4  BrO3\n–(aq)  +  5Br–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n3Br2(aq)  +  3H2O(l)\nrate = k[BrO3\n–] [Br–] [H+]2\nTable 22.3  Rate equations for some reactions.\nIn order to find the rate equation we have to conduct a \nseries of experiments.

For equation 2\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nin Table 22.3, the rate equation is rate = k[NO]2 and so the \norder is 2 with respect to [NO].\nWhen you are writing about order of reaction, you \nmust distinguish carefully between the order with respect \nto a particular reactant and the overall order of reaction. \nTaking equation 3 in Table 22.3 as an example:\nrate = k[H2] [NO]2\nWe say that this reaction is:\n■\n■\nfirst-order with respect to H2  \n(as rate is proportional to [H2]1)\n■\n■\nsecond-order with respect to NO  \n(as rate is proportional to [NO]2)\n■\n■\nthird-order overall (as the sum of the powers is 1 + 2  = 3).\nIn general terms, for a reaction A  +  B  \n  products, the \nrate equation can be written in the form:\nrate of reaction = k[A]m[B]n\nIn this equation:\n■\n■\n[A] and [B] are the concentrations of the reactants\n■\n■\nm and n are the orders of the reaction\n■\n■\nthe values of m and n can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or rarely higher\n■\n■\nwhen the value of m or n is 0 we can ignore the \nconcentration term because any number to the power of \nzero = 1.\nOrders of reaction are not always whole numbers. A few \nreactions have fractional orders. For example, the reaction:\nCH3CHO(g)  \n  CH4(g)  +  CO(g)\nhas an overall order of 1.5. The rate equation for this \nreaction is:\nrate = k[CH3CHO]1.5\nMany reactions involving free radicals have fractional \norders of reaction.\nQuestion\n5\t For each of the reactions a to e in question 4, state:\ni\t\n\u0007the order of reaction with respect to each reactant\nii\t the overall order of reaction.\n\nChapter 22: Reaction kinetics\nUnits of k\nThe units of k vary according to the form of the rate \nequation.\nworked examples\n1\t From equation 1 in Table 22.3.\nStep 1  Write the rate equation\nrate = k[H2] [I2]\nStep 2  Rearrange the equation in terms of k.\nk = ​  rate \n_______ \n[H2] [I2] ​\nStep 3  Substitute the units.\nk = ​ \nmol dm–3 s–1 \n \n____________________ \n \n(mol dm–3) × (mol dm–3) ​\nStep 4  Cancel mol dm–3 .\nk = ​ \nmol dm–3 s–1 \n \n____________________ \n \n(mol dm–3) × (mol dm–3) ​\nStep 5  Units of k.\nunits of k =s–1 mol–1 dm3 = dm3 mol–1 s–1\n■\n■\nwhen writing the units on one line, the indices on \nthe bottom change sign\n331\n■\n■\nwe usually put the unit with the positive index first\n■\n■\ndon’t forget the s–1 arising from the units of rate.\n2\t From equation 3 in Table 22.3.\nStep 1  Write the rate equation.\nrate = k[H2] [NO]2\nStep 2  Rearrange the equation in terms of k.\nk = ​ \nrate \n_________ \n[H2] [NO]2 ​\nStep 3  Substitute the units.\nk = ​ \nmol dm–3 s–1 \n \n_____________________ \n \n(mol dm–3) × (mol dm–3)2 ​\nStep 4  Cancel mol dm–3.\nk = ​ \nmol dm–3 s–1 \n \n_____________________ \n \n(mol dm–3) × (mol dm–3)2 ​\nStep 5  Units of k.\nunits of k =s–1 mol–2 dm6 = dm6 mol–2 s–1\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n6\t State the units of k corresponding to each of the \nfollowing rate equations:\na\t rate = k[NO]2\nb\t rate = k[NH3]0\nc\t\nrate = k[BrO3\n–] [Br –][H+]2\nd\t rate = k[cyclopropane]\nWhich order of reaction?\nWe can identify the order of a reaction in three ways:\n■\n■\nplot a graph of reaction rate against concentration  \nof reactant\n■\n■\nplot a graph of concentration of reactant against time\n■\n■\ndeduce successive half-lives from graphs of concentration \nagainst time.\nGraphs of reaction rate against \nconcentration\nA graph of reaction rate against concentration tells us \nwhether a reaction is zero, first, second or third order with \nrespect to a particular reagent (or overall). It is very rare to \nobtain an order with respect to a particular reagent higher \nthan second order.

We call this the reaction \nmechanism. These steps do not take place at the same \nrate. The overall rate of reaction depends on the slowest \nstep. We call this the rate-determining step. If the \nconcentration of a reactant appears in the rate equation, \nthen that reactant (or substances that react together \nto form it) appears in the rate-determining step. If a \nsubstance does not appear in the overall rate equation it \ndoes not take part in the rate-determining step. So, for \nthe reaction between propanone and iodine, H+ ions are \ninvolved in the rate-determining step but iodine is not.\nVerifying possible reaction mechanisms\nWe can use kinetic data to confirm proposed reaction \nmechanisms. It is important to realise that the mechanism is not \ndeduced from the kinetic data. The kinetic data simply show us \nthat a proposed reaction mechanism is possible.\nVarious mechanisms have been proposed for the \nreaction\nH+\nCH3COCH3  +  I2  \n  CH3COCH2I  +  HI\nFigure 22.17 shows one proposed mechanism.\nThe rate equation for this reaction is\nrate = k[CH3COCH3] [H+]\nWe could not have deduced this reaction mechanism from \nthe rate equation. But the mechanism is consistent with \nthe rate equation.\nThe slow step (the rate-determining step) does not \ninvolve either propanone or hydrogen ions directly. \nHowever, the intermediate with the formula\n+OH\n\t\nCH3   C    CH3\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nfast\nO\n+OH\nCH3   +  H+\nCH3\nC\nCH3\nC\nCH3\n+OH\nOH\nslow\nC\n⎯⎯→\nC\n+ H +\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nCH2\n+ I2\nC\nfast\nOH\n+OH\nC\nCH2I + I–\n⎯⎯→\nCH3\nCH3\nCH2\n+OH\nCH3\nfast\nO\nCH2I  +  I–\nC\nCH2I   +   HI\nC\nCH3\nFigure 22.17  Propanone molecules rapidly accept hydrogen \nions to form an intermediate that slowly forms propen-2-ol. \nThis reacts rapidly with iodine to give the products.\nis derived from substances that react together to form it \n(propanone and hydrogen ions).

The subsequent reactions are very much faster by comparison, and do not influence the overall rate.  \nTry to match the reaction steps with the illustrations to get a picture of what is happening.\n\nChapter 22: Reaction kinetics\nCH3C(OH)   CH2 is fast and iodine molecules are \nnot involved in the mechanism until after the rate-\ndetermining step. So the rate of reaction does not depend \non the concentration of iodine.\nOn page 337 we saw that the rate equation for the reaction\n2N2O5(g)  \n  4NO2(g)  +  O2\nis rate = k[N2O5]. Figure 22.18 shows a suggested \nmechanism for this reaction. The rate equation \nsuggests that a single N2O5 molecule is involved in the \nrate-determining step. This fits in with the proposed \nmechanism that suggests that the decomposition of N2O5 \nto form NO2 and NO3 is the slow step. The steps that follow \nthe slow step are relatively fast and so have no effect on \nreaction rate.\nIf there is only a single species (atom, ion or molecule) \nin the rate-determining step we call the reaction \nunimolecular. If two species (which can be the same or \ndifferent) are involved in the rate-determining step, we say \nthat the reaction is bimolecular. Mechanisms that involve \na trimolecular step are rare. This is because it is unlikely \nthat three species will collide at the same time.\n339\nfast\n2\nfast\n+\n3\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n14\t An acidified solution of hydrogen peroxide reacts with \niodide ions.\nH2O2(aq)  +  2H+(aq)  +  2I–(aq)  \n  2H2O(l)  +  I2(aq)\nThe rate equation for this reaction is\nrate = [H2O2] [I–]\n\u0007The mechanism below has been proposed for this \nreaction.\nslow\n\t\nH2O2  +  I–  \n  H2O  +  IO–\nfast\n\t\nH+  +  IO–  \n  HIO\nfast\n\t\nHIO  +  H+  +  I–  \n  I2  +  H2O\nExplain why this mechanism is consistent with the rate \nequation.\nPredicting the order of a reaction from \nreaction mechanisms\nWe can predict the order of reaction from a given reaction \nmechanism if we know the intermediates present in the \nrate-determining step (or substances that react together to \nform the intermediate).

They do this by providing an \nalternative pathway for the reaction with lower activation \nenergy. We can divide catalysts into two main classes.\n■\n■\nHomogeneous catalysis occurs when the catalyst is in the \nsame phase as the reaction mixture.

The strength \nand puncture resistance of this polymer film is being shown \nwith a ball-point pen.\nHomogeneous catalysis\nHomogeneous catalysis often involves changes in \noxidation number of the ions involved in catalysis. For \nexample, small amounts of iodide ions catalyse the \ndecomposition of hydrogen peroxide. In the catalysed \nreaction, iodide ions, I–, are first oxidised to iodate(I) ions, \nIO–. The IO– ions then react with further molecules of \nhydrogen peroxide and are reduced back to iodide ions.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nH2O2(aq)  +  I–(aq)  \n  H2O(l)  +  IO–(aq)\nH2O2(aq)  +  IO–(aq)  \n  H2O(l)  +  I–(aq)  +  O2(g)\nThe overall equation is:\nI–\n2H2O2(aq)  \n  2H2O(l)  +  O2(g)\nIons of transition elements are often good catalysts because \nof their ability to change oxidation number.\nExamples of homogeneous catalysis\nThe iodine–peroxodisulfate reaction\nPeroxodisulfate (persulfate) ions, S2O8\n2–, oxidise iodide \nions to iodine.

In order to collide and react, these ions need \nconsiderable energy to overcome the repulsive forces when \nlike charges approach each other.\nFe3+(aq) ions catalyse this reaction. The catalysis \ninvolves two redox reactions.\n■\n■\nReaction 1: reduction of Fe3+ ions to Fe2+ ions by I– ions:\n2Fe3+(aq)  +  2I–(aq)  \n  2Fe2+(aq)  +  I2(aq)\n■\n■\nReaction 2: oxidation of Fe2+ ions back to Fe3+ by S2O8\n2– ions:\n2Fe2+(aq)  +  S2O8\n2–(aq)  \n  2Fe3+(aq)  +  2SO4\n2–(aq)\nIn both reactions 1 and 2, positively charged iron ions \nreact with negatively charged ions. As ions with unlike \ncharges are attracted to each other, these reactions are \nmore likely to occur than direct reaction between S2O8\n2– \nand I– ions.\nYou should notice that it doesn’t matter what the order \nis of the two reactions. The oxidation of Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ \nby S2O8\n2– ions could happen first:\n2Fe2+(aq)  +  S2O8\n2–(aq)  \n  2Fe3+(aq)  +  2SO4\n2–(aq)\nfollowed by\n2Fe3+(aq)  +  2I–(aq)  \n  2Fe2+(aq)  +  I2(aq)\nThis reaction is catalysed by Fe3+(aq) and it is also \ncatalysed by Fe2+(aq).\nFigure 22.21 shows an energy level profile for the \ncatalysed and the uncatalysed reactions.

Transition elements such as \nnickel are particularly good at chemisorbing hydrogen gas. \nFigure 22.23 shows the process of adsorption of hydrogen \nonto a nickel surface.\nYou must be careful to distinguish between the words \nadsorb and absorb.

From experimental results, he suggested a \nrelationship between entropy change (∆S), the energy transferred \nreversibly from the surroundings (q) and the temperature (T):\nΔS =  q \n__ T \nFigure 23.1 Potassium reacts spontaneously \nwith water.\nIntroducing entropy\nEntropy is a measure of the dispersal of energy at a specifi c \ntemperature. Entropy can also be thought of as a measure \nof the randomness or disorder of a system. Th e higher \nthe randomness or disorder, the greater the entropy of \nthe system. A system is the part under investigation. In \nchemistry this is the chemical reaction itself, i.e. reactants \nbeing converted to products. Th e system of magnesium \nreacting with sulfuric acid in a test tube to form magnesium \nsulfate and hydrogen releases energy to the surroundings. \nTh e surroundings include:\n350\n■\n■\nthe solvent (in this case water)\n■\n■\nthe air around the test tube\n■\n■\nthe test tube itself\n■\n■\nanything dipping into the test tube (e.g. a thermometer).\nChanges that tend to continue to happen naturally are \ncalled spontaneous changes. Once started, a spontaneous \nchange will carry on. When a light is applied, methane \ngas reacts with oxygen in a spontaneous reaction to form \ncarbon dioxide and water. Th e reaction is spontaneous \nbecause the methane continues to burn in the oxygen until\nAr atom\nbefore mixing\nHe atom\nincrease in entropy\nFigure 23.2 The spontaneous mixing of helium atoms (\n\neither the methane or oxygen is completely used up. For \na reaction to be spontaneous, it does not need to happen \nrapidly. Many spontaneous reactions are slow or need an \ninput of energy to start them.\nEntropy can also be thought of as a dispersal of energy, \neither from the system to the surroundings or from \nthe surroundings to the system. Th e system becomes \nenergetically more stable when it becomes more disordered.\nChance and spontaneous change\nDiff usion\nIf you spill a few drops of perfume in a closed room with \nno air draughts, the smell spreads gradually throughout \nthe room. Th e molecules in the perfume vapour, which \nare responsible for the smell, move randomly in straight \nlines until they collide with air molecules, other perfume \nmolecules or with the walls of the room. Aft er collision, \nthe perfume molecules change direction. Th is process of \nrandom movement and random collisions of molecules is \ncalled diff usion. Th e reason molecules in a vapour diff use \nis because of the laws of chance and probability.\nafter mixing\n) with argon atoms (\n).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nWe can make a model to show how, during a \nspontaneous process, the entropy of the system increases. \nFigure 23.2 shows a system of two flasks connected by \na stopcock. One flask contains helium and the other \ncontains argon. These gases do not react.\nWhen the stopcock is opened, the gas atoms move \nspontaneously by diffusion. After mixing, the gases are \nmixed up and there is more disorder than before mixing. \nThe entropy has increased.\nDiffusion and number of ways\nWe can show that the molecules in a vapour diffuse by \nchance by thinking about the probability of finding them \nat one place at any one time. Consider the simplified \nmodel shown below.\npartition\n1\n3\n2\ngas jar B\ngas jar A\nThe three molecules in gas jar A cannot move into gas  \njar B.\nIn this model we assume that:\n■\n■\nthere are only a few molecules in gas jar A\n■\n■\nthere are no other particles present\n■\n■\nthe molecules move randomly and change directions \nwhen they collide.\nAfter we remove the partition, the molecules can move \nrandomly not only within gas jar A but also into gas jar \nB. There are three molecules and two places in which they \ncan be (gas jar A and gas jar B). The number of ways of \narranging the molecules after removing the partition is \nshown in Figure 23.3.\n2\n1\n2\n1\n3\n3\n2\n2\n1\n1\n3\n3\n3\n1\n2\n2\n3\n1\n3\n2\n1\n3\n1\n2\nFigure 23.3  The eight possible arrangements of molecules \nafter removing the partition between the gas jars.\n\nChapter 23: Entropy and Gibbs free energy\nThere are eight different ways of arranging the three \nmolecules between two gas jars. We can express this as:\nnumber of molecules\n2 × 2 × 2 = 23 = 8\ntwo gas jars\nEach of these ways is equally likely (probable). So the \nchance that all the molecules will stay in gas jar A is 1 in \n8. Similarly, the chance that all three molecules will move \nover to gas jar B is 1 in 8. The molecules diffuse because \nthere are more ways of them being spread out than \nremaining in the same place.\nIf we started with five molecules in gas jar A, the \nnumber of ways of arranging the molecules is 25 = 32 \ndifferent ways. If we scaled this up to the numbers of \ngas molecules that we might find in a container in the \nlaboratory, the number of ways of arranging the  \nmolecules is extremely large; for example, for a million \nmolecules between two gas jars it would be 21 000 000, a \nnumber that is too large for your calculator to deal with. \nSo diffusion happens because there is an overwhelming \nlikelihood of it taking place as a result of the large number \nof ways of arranging the molecules. The idea of the \n‘number of ways’ of arranging either molecules or the \nenergy within molecules dictates whether the changes \nthat take place are the ones that are most likely to happen. \nThis applies to chemical reactions as well as to physical \nprocesses such as diffusion.\n351\nQuestion\n1\t a\t \u0007For this question refer back to Figure 23.3.

Standard \nmolar entropy is the entropy of one mole of substance in \nits standard state. The symbol \nO\n— indicates that the entropy \nis at standard conditions.\nTable 23.1 shows some values for some standard  \nmolar entropies.\nSubstance\nS O\n—\n     / \n J K–1  mol–1\nSubstance\nS O\n—\n     /  \nJ K–1 mol–1\ndiamond (s)\n  2.4\nmethanol (l)\n239.7\ngraphite (s)\n  5.7\nwater (l)\n 69.9\ncalcium (s)\n 41.4\ncarbon \nmonoxide (g)\n197.6\nlead (s)\n 64.8\nhydrogen (g)\n130.6\n352\ncalcium oxide (s)\n 39.7\nhelium (g)\n126.0\ncalcium \ncarbonate (s)\n 92.9\nammonia (g)\n192.3\nmercury (l)\n 76.0\noxygen (g)\n205.0\nbromine (l)\n151.6\ncarbon \ndioxide (g)\n213.6\nTable 23.1  Standard molar entropy values of some solids, \nliquids and gases. The states are shown as state symbols after \neach substance.\nThe values of all standard molar entropies are positive. \nRemember that elements have positive standard molar \nentropy values. Do not get this muddled with the case of \nenthalpies, where the elements in their standard states \nhave entropy values of zero. The entropy values are \ncompared to a theoretically perfect crystal. The Third Law \nof Thermodynamics states that ‘All perfect crystals have \nthe same entropy at a temperature of absolute zero’. The \nnearest we can get to this is a perfect diamond weighing \n12 g cooled to as low a temperature as possible.\nFrom the values in the table and other data we can \nmake some generalisations:\n■\n■\nGases generally have much higher entropy values than \nliquids, and liquids have higher entropy values than \nsolids. There are exceptions to this. For example, calcium\n\nFigure 23.4  A diamond has a very low entropy value because \nit is a solid element with atoms regularly arranged. Bromine \nhas a high entropy value because it tends to spread out.\ncarbonate (solid) has a higher entropy value than mercury \n(liquid).\n■\n■\nSimpler substances with fewer atoms have lower  \nentropy values than more complex substances with a \ngreater number of atoms. For example, for calcium oxide, \nCaO, S O\n—\n     = 39.7 J K–1 mol–1 but for calcium carbonate, \nCaCO3, S O\n—\n     = 92.9 J K–1 mol–1. Carbon monoxide, CO, has a \nlower entropy value than carbon dioxide, CO2.\n■\n■\nFor similar types of substances, harder substances have \na lower entropy value. For example, diamond has a lower \nentropy value than graphite and calcium has a lower \nentropy value than lead.\n■\n■\nFor a given substance the entropy increases as a solid \nmelts and then changes to a vapour (see Figure 23.5). For \nexample, the molar entropy of ice just below its melting \npoint is 48.0 J K–1 mol–1; the molar entropy for water \nis 69.9 J K–1 mol–1, but just above its boiling point, the \nvalue increases to 188.7 J K–1 mol–1. There is a gradual \nincrease in entropy as the temperature of a substance is \nincreased. Increasing the temperature of a solid makes \nthe molecules, atoms or ions vibrate more. Increasing \nthe temperature of a liquid or gas increases the entropy \nbecause it increases the disorder of the particles.

We will assume that gases have \nhigh entropy and solids have low entropy. If there is a \nchange in the number of gaseous molecules in a reaction, \nthere is likely to be a significant entropy change. This is\n\nChapter 23: Entropy and Gibbs free energy\nbecause high values of entropy are associated with gases. \nThe more gas molecules, there are, the greater is the \nnumber of ways of arranging them and the higher the \nentropy. For example in the reaction:\nCaCO3(s)   \n   CaO(s)  +  CO2(g)\nthere is an increase in entropy of the system because the \na gas is being produced (high entropy) but the reactant, \ncalcium carbonate, is a solid (low entropy).\nIn the reaction\n2N2O5(g)  \n  4NO2(g)  +  O2(g)\nwe should expect an increase of entropy of the system \nbecause there are a greater number of moles of gas \nmolecules in the products (5 molecules) than in the \nreactants (2 molecules). In addition, there are two  \ndifferent product molecules but only one type of reactant  \nmolecule. This also contributes to a greater disorder in \nthe products compared with the reactants. The system \nbecomes energetically more stable when it becomes  \nmore disordered. \nIn the reaction\nN2(g)  +  3H2(g)  \n  2NH3(g)\n353\nwe should expect a decrease in the entropy of the \nsystem because there is a reduction in the number of gas \nmolecules as the reaction proceeds. So the entropy change \nof the system is negative. The reactants, hydrogen and \nnitrogen, are more stable than the product, ammonia.\nQuestion\n3\t For each of the following reactions, suggest whether \nthe entropy of the reactants or the products will be \ngreater or whether it is difficult to decide.

The \nsurroundings are so large that when energy exchange \ntakes place there is such a small change in temperature or \npressure that we can ignore these.\n■\n■\nFor an exothermic reaction, the energy released to the \nsurroundings increases the number of ways of arranging the \nenergy. This is because the energy goes into rotation and \ntranslation (movement from place to place) of molecules \nin the surroundings. So there is likely to be an increase in \nentropy and an increased probability of the chemical change \noccurring spontaneously.\n■\n■\nFor an endothermic reaction, the energy absorbed \nfrom the surroundings decreases the number of ways of \narranging the energy. So there is likely to be a decrease \nin entropy and a decreased probability of the chemical \nchange occurring spontaneously.\nTotal entropy change\nWe can use entropy values to predict whether a chemical \nreaction will occur spontaneously or not. When a \nchemical reaction takes place there is a change in entropy \nbecause the reactants and products have different entropy \nvalues. The symbol for standard entropy change is ΔS \nO\n—\n   . \nThe total entropy change involves both the system and the \nsurroundings. For the system (reactants and products) we \nwrite the entropy change as ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem.\n354\nFor the surroundings we write the entropy change as \nΔS \nO\n—\nsurroundings.\nThe total entropy change is given by:\nΔS \nO\n—\ntotal = ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem  +  ΔS \nO\n—\nsurroundings\nIf the total entropy change increases, the entropy  \nchange is positive, e.g. ΔS \nO\n—\ntotal is +40 J K–1 mol–1 . The \nreaction will then occur spontaneously. We say that the \nreaction is feasible.\nIf the total entropy change decreases, the entropy \nchange is negative, e.g. ΔS \nO\n—\ntotal is –40 J K–1 mol–1. The \nreaction is then not likely to occur.\nCalculating the entropy change of the \nsystem\nIn order to calculate the entropy change of the system we \nuse the relationship:\nΔS \nO\n—\nsystem = S \nO\n—\nproducts – S \nO\n—\nreactants\n\nNote that:\n1\t We need to take account of the stoichiometry of the \nequation (as we did in calculations involving ΔH \nO\n—\n   ).\n2\t When looking up entropy values in tables of data, we \nneed to choose the data for the correct state, solid, \nliquid or gas.\nworked examples\n1\t Calculate the entropy change of the system for  \nthe reaction:\n2Ca(s)  +  O2(g)  \n  2CaO(s)\nThe standard entropy values are:\nS O\n—\n     [Ca(s)]\t\n= 41.40 J K–1 mol–1\nS O\n—\n     [O2(g)]\t\n= 205.0 J K–1 mol–1\nS O\n—\n     [CaO(s)]\t = 39.70 J K–1 mol–1\nΔS O\n—\nsystem = S O\n—\nproducts– S O\n—\nreactants\n= 2 × S O\n—\n     [CaO(s)] – {2 × S O\n—\n     [Ca(s)]  +  S O\n—\n     [O2(g)]}\n= 2 × 39.70 – {(2 × 41.40)  +  205.0}\n= 79.40 – 287.8\nΔS O\n—\nsystem = –208.4 J K–1 mol–1\nThe negative value for the entropy change  \nshows that the entropy of the system has decreased. \nWe know, however, that calcium reacts \nspontaneously with oxygen.

The units are kJ mol–1.\nFor example:\nMg(s)  +  ​ 1 _ \n2 ​ O2(g)  \n  MgO(s)\b\nΔG \nO\n—\nf  = –569.4 kJ mol–1\nDerivation\nGibbs free energy can easily be derived from the equation \nrelating total entropy to the entropy changes of system and \nsurroundings.\nAs:\nΔS \nO\n—\ntotal = ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem – ​ ΔH \nO\n—\n    \n_____ \nT  ​\nMultiplying by –T: –TΔS \nO\n—\ntotal  = –TΔS \nO\n—\nsystem  +  ΔH \nO\n—\n   \nThe term –TΔS \nO\n—\nsystem  +  ΔH \nO\n—\n    is equivalent to the Gibbs \nfree energy change of the reaction system ΔG \nO\n—\n   .\nSo –TΔS \nO\n—\ntotal = ΔG \nO\n—\n    and so ΔG \nO\n—\n    = ΔH \nO\n—\n    – TΔS \nO\n—\nsystem.\nGibbs free energy and spontaneous \nreactions\nFor a reaction to be spontaneous, ΔS \nO\n—\ntotal  must be \npositive. The value of T is always positive on the absolute \n(kelvin) temperature scale. So applying these signs to \nthe relationship ΔG \nO\n—\n    = –TΔS \nO\n—\ntotal, the value of ΔG must \nbe negative for a reaction to be spontaneous. So, when a \nspontaneous reaction occurs at constant temperature and \npressure, the Gibbs free energy decreases.

Iron and copper \nhave been used for many centuries (Figure 24.1). \nIn more recent times, we have discovered how to\nFigure 24.1  The transition elements iron and copper are very important in the construction industry.\nWhat is a transition element?\nThe transition elements are found in the d block of the \nPeriodic Table, between Groups 2 and 13. However, not all \nd-block elements are classified as transition elements.\nA transition element is a d-block element that forms one \nor more stable ions with an incomplete d subshell.\nWe do not define Sc and Zn as transition elements.\n■\n■\nScandium forms only one ion (Sc3+) and this has no \nelectrons in its 3d subshell – the electronic configuration of \nSc3+ is (Ar) 3d0 4s0.\n■\n■\nZinc forms only one ion (Zn2+) and this has a complete \n3d subshell – the electronic configuration of Zn2+ is (Ar) \n3d10 4s0.\nIn this chapter we will be looking at the transition \nelements in the first row of the d block. These are the \nmetals titanium (Ti) through to copper (Cu), according to \nthe definition above.\nElectronic configurations\nAtoms\nTable 24.1 shows the electronic configurations of the atoms \nin the first row of the transition elements.\n\nChapter 24: Transition elements\nextract and use other, rarer transition elements. For \nexample, titanium is used in jet turbines because it can \nwithstand high temperatures and is very strong.\nIn atoms of the transition elements, the 4s subshell is \nnormally filled and the rest of the electrons occupy orbitals \nin the 3d subshell. However, chromium and copper \natoms are the exceptions. Chromium atoms have just one \nelectron in the 4s subshell. The remaining five electrons \nare arranged in the 3d subshell so that each orbital is \noccupied by one electron. Copper atoms also have just one \nelectron in the 4s subshell. The remaining ten electrons are \narranged in the 3d subshell so that each orbital is filled by \ntwo electrons.\n367\nElement\nElectronic configuration\ntitanium (Ti)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2 4s2\nvanadium (V)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d3 4s2\nchromium (Cr)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s1\nmanganese (Mn)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s2\niron (Fe)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d6 4s2\ncobalt (Co)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d7 4s2\nnickel (Ni)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d8 4s2\ncopper (Cu)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s1\nTable 24.1  Electronic configurations of the first row of \ntransition elements.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nIons\nThe transition elements are all metals. In common with \nall metals, their atoms tend to lose electrons so they form \npositively charged ions. However, each transition metal can \nform more than one ion. For example, the common ions of \ncopper are Cu+ and Cu2+. We say that the transition metals \nhave variable oxidation states. The resulting ions are often \ndifferent colours (Figure 24.2).\na\nb\nc\nd\nFigure 24.2  Vanadium and its oxidation states: a  a solution \ncontaining VO2\n+ ions; b  a solution containing VO2+ ions; c  a \nsolution containing V3+ ions; d  a solution containing V2+ ions.\n368\nTable 24.2 shows the most common oxidation states of the \nfirst row of the transition elements.\nElement\nMost common oxidation states\ntitanium (Ti)\n+3, +4\nvanadium (V)\n+2, +3, +4, +5\nchromium (Cr)\n+3, +6\nmanganese (Mn)\n+2, +4, +6, +7\niron (Fe)\n+2, +3\ncobalt (Co)\n+2, +3\nnickel (Ni)\n+2\ncopper (Cu)\n+1, +2\nTable 24.2  Common oxidation states of the transition \nelements.\nThe existence of variable oxidation states means that the \nnames of compounds containing transition elements must \nhave their oxidation number included, e.g. manganese(IV) \noxide, cobalt(II) chloride.\nWhen transition elements form ions, their atoms  \nlose electrons from the 4s subshell first, followed by  \n3d electrons.\n\nNotice the partially filled d subshells (see definition of \ntransition element on the previous page) in the following \nexamples of ions:\nV atom = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d3 4s2\nV3+ ion = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2 4s0\nFe atom = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d6 4s2\nFe3+ ion = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s0\nCu atom = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s1\nCu2+ ion = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d9 4s0\nThe most common oxidation state is +2, usually formed \nwhen the two 4s electrons are lost from the atoms. The \nmaximum oxidation number of the transition elements at \nthe start of the row involves all the 4s and 3d electrons in \nthe atoms. For example, vanadium’s maximum oxidation \nstate is +5, involving its two 4s electrons and its three \n3d electrons. At the end of the row, from iron onwards, \nthe +2 oxidation state dominates as 3d electrons become \nincreasingly harder to remove as the nuclear charge \nincreases across the period.\nQuestion\n1\t a\t \u0007State the electronic configurations of the following \natoms or ions:\ni\t\nTi\t\niv\t Fe3+\nii\t Cr\t\nv\t Ni2+\niii\t Co\t\nvi\t Cu+\nb\t \u0007Explain why scandium (which forms only one ion, \nSc3+) and zinc (which forms only one ion, Zn2+)  \nare not called transition elements.\nc\t\n\u0007Why is the maximum oxidation state of  \nmanganese +7?\nd\t \u0007Look back at the different oxidation states  \nof vanadium shown in Figure 24.2.

In general, the 1st ionisation energy \nwould increase as the increasing nuclear charge has a \ntighter hold on electrons filling the same main energy level \nor shell, and the shielding effect stays roughly the same. \nFor similar reasons the atomic radius and ionic radius of \na positively charged ion would be expected to decrease\n\nChapter 24: Transition elements\nacross a period. However, the transition elements show \nonly a very small variation.\nComparing the transition elements with \nan s-block element\nThe s-block metal that lies immediately before the first row \nof d-block elements in the Periodic Table is calcium (Ca), \nin Group 2. When we compare the properties of calcium \nwith the first row of transition elements we find some \ndifferences despite the fact that they are all metals. You \nneed to know the following comparisons:\n■\n■\nthe melting point of calcium (839 °C) is lower than that of a \ntransition element (e.g. titanium at 1660 °C)\n■\n■\nthe density of calcium (1.55g cm–3) is lower than that of a \ntransition element (e.g. nickel at 8.90 g cm–3)\n■\n■\nthe atomic radius of calcium (0.197 nm) is larger than that of \na transition element (e.g. iron at 0.116 nm)\n■\n■\nthe ionic radius of the calcium ion, Ca2+, (0.099 nm) is larger \nthan that of a transition element (e.g. Mn2+ at 0.080 nm)\n■\n■\nthe first ionisation energy of calcium (590 kJ mol–1) is \nlower than that of a transition element (e.g. chromium at \n653 kJ mol–1 or cobalt at 757 kJ mol–1)\n■\n■\nthe electrical conductivity of calcium is higher than that of a \ntransition element (with the exception of copper).\n369\nQuestion\n2\t a\t \u0007Explain why the 1st ionisation energy of calcium is \nlower than that of cobalt.\nb\t \u0007Explain why the density of calcium is lower than \nthe density of nickel.\nRedox reactions\nWe have seen how the transition elements can exist in \nvarious oxidation states. When a compound of a transition \nelement is treated with a suitable reagent, the oxidation \nstate of the transition element can change. Whenever a \nreaction involves reactants changing their oxidation states \nthe reaction is a redox reaction, involving the transfer \nof electrons. Remember that a species is reduced when \nits oxidation state is reduced (gets lower in value). Its \noxidation state is lowered when it gains electrons, and, as \nwell as being reduced, it is acting as an oxidising agent. For \nexample, in the half-equation:\nFe3+(aq)  +  e–   \n   Fe2+(aq)\n\tpale yellow\t\npale green\nFe3+ has been reduced to Fe2+ by gaining one electron. In the \nequation as shown Fe3+ is acting as an oxidising agent. For this\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nreaction to happen another half-equation is needed in which \nthe reactant loses one or more electrons, i.e. acts as a reducing \nagent. In Chapter 20 (page 286) we saw how we can use \nstandard electrode potential values, E \nO\n—\n   , to predict whether or \nnot such reactions should take place.\nAnother half-equation we could consider would be:\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–   \n   Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\n\t\npurple\t\npale pink\nBoth half-equations are written below as they appear in \ntables of data showing standard electrode potentials:\nFe3+(aq)  +  e–   \n   Fe2+(aq) \b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.77 V\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–   \n  Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.52 V\nCan Fe3+ ions oxidise Mn2+ to MnO4\n– ions, or can MnO4\n– \nions in acid solution oxidise Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions?\nThe magnitude of the positive values provides a \nmeasure of the tendency of the half-equations to  \nproceed to the right-hand side. The values show us that \nMnO4\n–(aq) is more likely to accept electrons and proceed \nin the forward direction, changing to Mn2+(aq), than \nFe3+(aq) is to accept electrons and change to Fe2+(aq). \nMnO4\n–(aq) is a more powerful oxidising agent than \nFe3+(aq). Therefore MnO4\n–(aq) ions are capable of \noxidising Fe2+(aq) ions to form Fe3+(aq), and the top  \nhalf-equation proceeds in the reverse direction.\nWe can now combine the two half-cells to get the \noverall reaction. Note that the sign of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) \nhalf-cell has changed by reversing its direction. the  \nFe2+/Fe3+ equation also has to be multiplied by 5 so that \nthe electrons on either side of the equation cancel out (this \ndoes not affect the value of E \nO\n—\n   ).\n370\n5Fe2+(aq)  \n  5Fe3+(aq)  +  5e–\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = –0.77 V\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–  \n  Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.52 V\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  5Fe2+(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  \n  \nMn2+(aq)  +  5Fe3+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.75 V\nThe relatively large positive value of E \nO\n—\n    (+0.75 V) tells \nus that the reaction is likely to proceed in the forward \ndirection as written. In fact we use this reaction to \ncalculate the amount of iron (Fe2+ ions) in a sample, such \nas an iron tablet, by carrying out a titration.\n\n■\n■\nA known volume (e.g. 25 cm3) of an unknown concentration \nof Fe2+(aq) is placed in a conical flask.\n■\n■\nA solution of a known concentration of potassium \nmanganate(VII) is put in a burette.\n■\n■\nThe potassium manganate(VII) solution is titrated against the \nsolution containing Fe2+(aq) in the conical flask.\n■\n■\nThe purple colour of the manganate(VII) ions is removed in \nthe reaction with Fe2+(aq). The end-point is reached when \nthe Fe2+(aq) ions have all reacted and the first permanent \npurple colour appears in the conical flask.\nFigure 24.3  Manganate(VII) ions can be used to determine \nthe percentage of Fe2+ in an iron tablet.\nYou can achieve a more accurate result for the mass of Fe2+ \nin a solution by using dichromate(VI) ions, Cr2O7\n2–(aq), \nto oxidise it in a titration. This is because compounds such \nas potassium dichromate(VI) can be prepared to a higher \ndegree of purity than potassium manganate(VII). In a \ntitration with Fe2+(aq) and dichromate(VI) we need an \nindicator of the end-point that will be oxidised as soon as \nthe Fe2+(aq) has all reacted.\nThe half-equation and value for E \nO\n—\n    for the use of \ndichromate as an oxidising agent is:\nCr2O7\n2–(aq) + 14H+(aq) + 6e–  \n  2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.33 V\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nworked example\n1\t 0.420 g of iron ore were dissolved in acid, so that all of \nthe iron present in the original ore was then present \nas Fe2+(aq).

Different \nligands form complexes with different stabilities. For \nexample when we add concentrated aqueous ammonia to \nan aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate, the ammonia \nligands displace water ligands in a stepwise process.\n[Cu(H2O)6]2+ (aq)  +  NH3(aq)\n[Cu(NH3)(H2O)5]2+(aq)  +  H2O(l)\n[Cu(NH3)(H2O)5]2+(aq)  +  NH3(aq)\n[Cu(NH3)2(H2O)4]2+(aq)  +  H2O(l)\nAs we increase the concentration of ammonia, this \nprocess continues until four of the water molecules are \nreplaced by ammonia to form a deep blue solution. The \noverall process is:\n[Cu(H2O)6]2+  +  4NH3(aq)\n[Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nWe can think of this exchange of ligands in terms of \ncompeting equilibria of the forward and backward \nreactions. The position of equilibrium lies in the direction \nof the more stable complex. In this case, the complex with \nammonia as a ligand is more stable than the complex with \njust water as a ligand. If we dilute the complex with water, \nthe position of equilibrium shifts to the left and a complex \nwith more water molecules as ligands is formed.\nThe stability of the complex is expressed in terms of \nthe equilibrium constants for ligand displacement. This is \ncalled the stability constant. Usually an overall stability \nconstant, Kstab, is given rather than the stepwise constants. \nThe stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the \nformation of the complex ion in a solvent from its constituent \nions or molecules. The method for writing equilibrium \nexpressions for stability constants is similar to the one we \nused for writing Kc (see page 304). So for the equilibrium\n375\n[Cu(H2O)6]2+  +  4Cl–(aq)  \n  [CuCl4]2–(aq)  +  6H2O(l)\nthe expression is:\nKstab = ​ \n[[CuCl4]2–(aq)] \n \n_____________________ \n \n[[Cu(H2O)6]2+] [Cl–(aq)]4 ​\nNote:\n■\n■\nwater does not appear in the equilibrium expression \nbecause it is in such a large excess that its concentration is \nregarded as being constant\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\n■\n■\nthe units for the stability constant are worked out in the \nsame way as for the units of Kc (see page 124). For example, \nin the above case:\nKstab\t= ​ \n[[CuCl4]2–(aq)] \n \n_____________________ \n \n[[Cu(H2O)6]2+] [Cl–(aq)]4 ​  ​ \n(mol dm–3) \n \n_____________________ \n \n(mol dm–3) × (mol dm–3)4 ​\n= dm12 mol–4\nStability constants are often given on a log10 scale. When \nexpressed on a log10 scale, they have no units. Stability \nconstants can be used to compare the stability of any two \nligands. The values quoted usually give the stability of the \ncomplex relative to the aqueous ion where the ligand is \nwater. The higher the value of the stability constant, the \nmore stable the complex. Table 24.5 gives some values \nof stability constants for various copper(II) complexes \nrelative to their aqueous ions.\nLigand\nlog10 Kstab\nchloride, Cl–\n 5.6\nammonia, NH3\n13.1\n2-hydroxybenzoate\nCO2–\n16.9\n376\nOH\n25.0\n1,2-dihydroxybenzene\nOH\nOH\nTable 24.5  The stability constants of some complexes  \nof copper.\nFrom the table you can see that, in general, complexes \nwith bidentate ions (2-hydroxybenzoate and \n1,2-dihydroxybenzene) have higher stability constants than  \nthose with monodentate ligands. We can use the values of \nthe stability constants to predict the effect of adding different \nligands to complex ions. For example, the addition of excess  \nammonia to the complex [CuCl4]2–(aq) should result in the  \nformation of a dark blue solution of the ammonia complex  \nbecause the stability constant of the ammonia complex is  \nhigher than that of the chloride complex. The position of  \nequilibrium is shifted to the right in the direction of the more \nstable complex. Addition of excess 1,2-dihydroxybenzene \nto the dark blue ammonia complex results in the formation \nof a green complex with 1,2-dihydroxybenzene.

Would you expect to observe \nany changes? Explain your answer.\nThe colour of complexes\nYou cannot fail to notice the striking colours of complexes \ncontaining transition metal ions. But how do these colours \narise? White light is made up of all the colours of the \nvisible spectrum. When a solution containing a transition \nmetal ion in a complex appears coloured, part of the \nvisible spectrum is absorbed by the solution. However, that \nstill doesn’t explain why part of the spectrum is absorbed \nby transition metal ions. To answer this question we must \nlook in more detail at the d orbitals in the ions.\nThe five d orbitals in an isolated transition metal atom \nor ion are described as degenerate, meaning they are all at \nthe same energy level (Figure 24.13).\nIn the presence of ligands a transition metal ion is \nnot isolated. The co-ordinate bonding from the ligands \ncauses the five d orbitals in the transition metal ion to \nsplit into two sets of non-degenerate orbitals at slightly \ndifferent energy levels (Figure 24.14). In a complex with six\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nz\ny\nx\nx\ndyz\nz\ny\nx\ndx2–y2\nFigure 24.13 The degenerate d orbitals in a transition metal atom.\nligands, the ligands are arranged in an octahedral shape \naround the central metal ion. Th e lone pairs donated by \nthe ligands into the transition metal ion repel electrons in \nthe two dx2–y2 and dz2 orbitals shown in Figure 24.13 more \nthan those in the other three d orbitals. Th is is because \nthese d orbitals line up with the co-ordinate bonds in \nthe complex’s octahedral shape and so they are closer to \nthe bonding electrons in the octahedral arrangement, \nincreasing repulsion between electrons. Th erefore the \norbitals are split, with these two d orbitals at a slightly \nhigher energy level than the dyz, dxz and dxy orbitals \n(Figure 24.14).\nA Cu2+ ion has an electronic confi guration of \n[Ar] 3d9.

Th e diff erence in the energy \nbetween the non-degenerate d orbitals is labelled ΔE. ΔE is \npart of the visible spectrum of light. So, when light shines \non the solution containing the Cu(H2O)6\n2+ complex, \nan electron absorbs this amount of energy. It uses this \nenergy to jump into the higher of the two non-degenerate \nenergy levels. In copper complexes, the rest of the visible \nspectrum that passes through the solution makes it appear \nblue in colour.\nTh e exact energy diff erence (ΔE) between the non-\ndegenerate d orbitals in a transition metal ion is aff ected \nby many factors. One of these factors is the identity of the \nligands that surround the transition metal ion.

The colour change arises because the \npresence of the ammonia ligands causes the d orbitals to \nsplit by a different amount of energy. This means that the \nsize of ΔE changes and this results in a slightly different \namount of energy being absorbed by electrons jumping \nup to the higher orbitals. Therefore a different colour is \nabsorbed from visible light, so a different colour is seen.\nSummary\n■\t Each of the transition elements forms at least one \nion with a partially filled d orbital.

These compounds are now \ncalled aryl compounds. However, many \nchemicals with structures containing one or \nmore benzene rings do have strong odours.\nThe benzene ring\nThe ‘benzene ring’ is a particularly important functional \ngroup found in many organic compounds. A benzene \nring is a hexagon made of six carbon atoms bonded \ntogether in a particular way. Benzene rings are found in \nmany compounds that are commercially important – for \nexample as medicines, dyes and plastics.\nOrganic hydrocarbons containing one or more \nbenzene rings are called arenes. In general, compounds \nof benzene are known as aryl compounds or aromatic \ncompounds; an example is chlorobenzene, which is one of \nthe halogenoarenes.\nThe simplest arene is benzene itself. Its formula is \nC6H6. The early organic chemists struggled to work out \nits structure. However, around 1865 Friedrich August \nKekulé seemed to have solved the problem. He proposed \na hexagonal ring of carbon atoms, each bonded to one \nhydrogen atom. In Kekulé’s structure the hexagonal ring \ncontained three double C   C bonds (Figure 25.2).\n382\nThis is reflected in benzene’s name, which has the same \nending as the alkenes.\nH\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nalso shown as\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nFigure 25.2  Kekulé’s structure of benzene.\n\nFigure 25.1  This is a vanilla \norchid. Its seed pods contain \na substance called vanillin. \nIts molecules are based on a \nbenzene ring – as represented by \nthe hexagon with a circle inside \nin the structure shown below. \nVanillin is used to flavour foods \nsuch as ice cream and chocolate. \nIts structure is:\nOH\nO\nCH3\nO\nC\nH\nAs analytical techniques were developed, however, \nchemists found out that the benzene molecule was a \nplanar, perfectly symmetrical molecule. Kekulé’s structure \nwould suggest three shorter double C   C bonds and three \nlonger single C   C bonds in the ring. This would produce \na distorted hexagonal shape, not the perfect hexagonal \narrangement of carbon atoms in benzene’s actual \nmolecules. Figure 25.3 shows how we represent benzene’s \nskeletal formula.\nFigure 25.3  The skeletal formula of benzene. It can also be \nused in displayed formulae of aryl compounds, as on the \nprevious page showing the structure of vanillin.\nWe can now measure actual bond lengths. This was \nimpossible in the 19th century when Kekulé worked. \nTable 25.1 shows that the bond length of the carbon–\ncarbon bonds in benzene lie between the values for C   C \nsingle bonds and C   C double bonds.\nBond\nBond length / nm\nC   C\n0.154\nC   C\n0.134\ncarbon to carbon bond in benzene\n0.139\nTable 25.1  Comparing bond lengths.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nThe chemistry of benzene also suggests that the Kekulé \nstructure is incorrect. If there were three C   C bonds \nin benzene it would undergo addition reactions like the \nalkenes (see page 209). However, this is not the case. For \nexample, ethene will decolorise bromine water on mixing, \nbut benzene needs much harsher conditions.\nThe actual structure of benzene can be explained by \nconsidering the bonding in the molecule. Each carbon \natom in the hexagonal ring is sp2 hybridised (see page 57), \nsharing:\n■\n■\none pair of electrons with one of its neighbouring  \ncarbon atoms\n■\n■\none pair of electrons with its other neighbouring  \ncarbon atom\n■\n■\none pair of electrons with a hydrogen atom.\nThese are σ (sigma) bonds; covalent bonds with the pair \nof electrons found mainly between the nuclei of the atoms \nbonded to each other. Each carbon atom forms three σ \nbonds. That leaves one electron spare on each of the six \ncarbon atoms. Each carbon atom contributes this one \nelectron to a π (pi) bond (see page 57). However, the π \nbonds formed are not localised between pairs of carbon \natoms as in an alkene C   C bond (see page 193). Instead, \nthe π bonds in benzene spread over all six carbon atoms \nin the hexagonal ring. The six electrons in the π bonds are \nsaid to be delocalised.\nThe π bonding in benzene is formed by the overlap \nof carbon p atomic orbitals, one from each of the six \ncarbon atoms. To achieve maximum overlap, the benzene \nmolecule must be planar. The lobes of the p orbitals \noverlap to form a ring of delocalised electrons above \nand below the plane of the carbon atoms in the benzene \nmolecule. This is shown in Figure 25.4.\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\noverlap of p orbitals \nproduces a ring of \ndelocalised electrons \nabove and below the \nplane of benzene’s \ncarbon atoms\nFigure 25.4  The π bonding in benzene.

This occurs \nby substituting an atom, or group of atoms, for one or more \nhydrogen atoms attached to the benzene ring. The initial \nattack is usually by an electrophile, which is attracted to the \nhigh electron density around the benzene ring.\n384\nElectrophilic substitution with chlorine \nor bromine\nBenzene will react with bromine in the presence of an \nanhydrous iron(III) bromide catalyst. The catalyst can be \nmade in the reaction vessel by adding iron filings to the \nbenzene and bromine. The substitution reaction is:\nBr\nanhydrous\nFeBr3 catalyst\n+  HBr\n+  Br2\nAt first sight the electrophile that starts the attack on \nbenzene is not obvious. The electrophile is created when  \nan iron(III) bromide molecule polarises a bromine \nmolecule. The Br2 molecule forms a dative (co-ordinate) \nbond with iron(III) bromide by donating a lone pair of \nelectrons from one bromine atom into an empty 3d orbital \nin the iron. This draws electrons from the other bromine \natom in the Br2 molecule making it partially positive, \ncreating the electrophile.\n\nWe can think of the electrophile as a Br+ cation:\nBr\nBr\nFeBr3\nBr+\n  \n+ [FeBr4]–\nδ+\nδ–\nThe Br+ cation and the ‘electron-rich’ benzene ring are \nattracted to each other, as the mechanism below shows. \nRemember that the curly arrows show the movement of a \npair of electrons.\nBr\nH\nBr\nstage 1\n⎯⎯⎯→\n⎯⎯⎯→\nstage 2\n+ HBr\n[FeBr4]–\n(+FeBr3)\nBr+\n+\nA similar reaction happens when chlorine gas is bubbled \nthrough benzene at room temperature in the presence \nof a catalyst such as iron(III) chloride or aluminium \nchloride. The products of this electrophilic substitution \nare chlorobenzene and hydrogen chloride. The catalysts in \nthese reactions, i.e. FeBr3, AlCl3 and FeCl3, are known as \n‘halogen carriers’.\nWhen we halogenate methylbenzene or other \nalkylarenes, the halogen atom substitutes into the benzene \nring at positions 2 or 4. These positions are ‘activated’ \nby any electron-donating groups bonded directly to the \nbenzene ring (see Table 25.4 on page 390). Other  \nexamples of benzene compounds that are activated in \nthese positions are phenol and phenylamine. So when \nwe react methylbenzene with chlorine gas, using an \nanhydrous aluminium chloride catalyst, two products can \nbe made:\nCH3\nCH3\nCl\nCH3\nAlCl3\n + \n+  2HCl\n+  2Cl2\nCl\n2-chloromethyl-\n4-chloromethyl-\nbenzene\nbenzene\nIf excess chlorine gas is bubbled through, we can \nform 1-methyl-2,4-dichlorobenzene, 1-methyl-2,6-\ndichlorobenzene and 1-methyl-2,4,6-trichlorobenzene. \n(Remember that the 2 and 6 positions in substituted arenes \nare equivalent.)\nThe carbon–halogen bond in halogenoarenes is \nstronger than the equivalent bond in a halogenoalkane \nbecause one of the lone pairs on the halogen atom  \noverlaps slightly with the π bonding system in the benzene \nring. This gives the carbon–halogen bond a partial double \nbond character.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nNotice that the methyl side-chain is not affected under the \nconditions used in the reaction above. However, we learnt \non page 206 that chlorine will react with alkanes in the \npresence of ultraviolet (UV) light or strong sunlight. This \nis a free radical substitution reaction. So if the chlorine gas \nis passed into boiling methylbenzene, in the presence of \nUV light, the following reaction takes place:\nCH3\nCH2Cl\nboil\n +  HCl\n UV light\n+  Cl2\nchloromethyl-\nbenzene\nNote that there is no substitution into the benzene ring \nunder these conditions. In excess chlorine, eventually all \nthree of the hydrogen atoms on the methyl side-chain will \nbe replaced by chlorine atoms.\nQuestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write the equation for the reaction of chlorine  \nwith benzene in the presence of an iron(III) \nchloride catalyst.\n\u0007b\t \u0007What do we call this type of mechanism for the \nreaction in part a?\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Draw the mechanism of the reaction in part a, with \nCl+ as the attacking species and using curly arrows \nto show the movement of electron pairs.\n\u0007d\t \u0007Draw the displayed formula of the ‘tri-substituted’ \nhalogenoarene produced if methylbenzene is \nadded to excess bromine at room temperature in \nthe presence of iron(III) bromide.\n\u0007e\t \u0007How would the reaction in part d differ if the \nmethylbenzene and bromine were boiled in the \npresence of UV light?\n\u0007f\t\n\u0007Name the mechanism of the reaction in part e.\nNitration of benzene\nThe nitration of benzene is another example of an \nelectrophilic substitution. Nitration refers to the \nintroduction of the NO2 group into a molecule. In this \nreaction the electrophile is the NO2\n+ ion, known as the\n\nChapter 25: Benzene and its compounds\nnitronium ion (or nitryl cation). This is made from a \nmixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated \nsulfuric acid:\nHNO3  +  2H2SO4  \n  NO2\n+  +  2HSO4\n–  +  H3O+\nThis ‘nitrating mixture’ is refluxed with benzene at about \n55 °C to make nitrobenzene:\nNO2\n+  HNO3\n+  H2O\n⎯→\nThe mechanism of the electrophilic substitution is:\nNO2\nNO2\nH\n+\nstage 1\nstage 2\nNO2\n+\n+  H+\nIn stage 1 in the mechanism, the electrophile, NO2\n+, is \nattracted to the high electron density of the π bonding \nsystem in benzene. A pair of electrons from the benzene \nring is donated to the nitrogen atom in NO2\n+, and forms \na new covalent bond. At this point, benzene’s delocalised \nring of electrons is disrupted. There are now four π \nbonding electrons and a positive charge spread over five \ncarbon atoms.\nHowever, the full delocalised ring is restored in stage 2 \nwhen the C   H bond breaks heterolytically. Both electrons in \nthe C   H covalent bond go into nitrobenzene’s π bonding \nsystem, and hydrogen leaves as an H+ ion. There are now \nsix electrons spread over the six carbon atoms, so the \nchemical stability of the benzene ring is retained in this \nsubstitution reaction.\nFurther nitration of the nitrobenzene produces \n1,3-dinitrobenzene and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene. Unlike \nthe electron-donating methyl group in methylbenzene \n(which activates the 2 and 4 positions in the benzene \nring), the NO2 group is electron-withdrawing. This type \nof group (which includes COOH) deactivates the 2 and \n4 positions in the benzene ring. Therefore, when there \nis a nitro group bonded to the benzene ring, further \nsubstitution takes place at the 3 and 5 positions (see Table \n25.4, page 390).\n385\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n4\t \u0007a\t \u0007Copy and complete the two equations below, \nwhich can be used to show the nitration of \nmethylbenzene:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007C6H5CH3  +  NO2\n+  \n  \n  +  \n\t\n H2SO4\n\t\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007C6H5CH3  +  HNO3  \n  \n  +\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007Name the possible mono-substituted products \nin parts i and ii.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iv\t \u00071-methyl-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 1-methyl-\n2,4,6-trinitrobenzene are formed on further \nnitration of methylbenzene.

It is used to manufacture a wide range of products \n(Figure 25.5). Its structure is:\nOH\n387\nFigure 25.5  Araldite adhesive, compact discs and TCP® \nantiseptic (which contains 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, as  \ndoes Dettol®) are all manufactured using phenol as a  \nstarting material.\nThe melting point of phenol is relatively high for an aryl \ncompound of its molecular mass because of hydrogen \nbonding between its molecules. However, the large  \nnon-polar benzene ring makes phenol only slightly  \nsoluble in water, as it disrupts hydrogen bonding with \nwater molecules.\nPhenol is weakly acidic, losing an H+ ion from its \nhydroxyl group:\nC6H5OH(aq)  \n  C6H5O–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n\t\nphenoxide ion\nThe position of this equilibrium lies well over to the \nleft-hand side.

We can explain this \nby looking at the conjugate bases formed on the right-hand \nside of the equations in Table 25.3. The phenoxide ion, \nC6H5O–(aq), has its negative charge spread over the whole \nion as one of the lone pairs on the oxygen atom overlaps \nwith the delocalised π bonding system in the benzene ring.\n–\nO\nO–\nCH3CH2\nethoxide ion, with\nphenoxide ion,\nwith negative\ncharge spread over\nthe whole ion\nnegative charge\nconcentrated on\n388\nthe oxygen\nThis delocalisation reduces the charge density of the \nnegative charge on the phenoxide ion compared with \nOH–(aq) or C2H5O–(aq). Therefore H+(aq) ions are not \nas strongly attracted to the phenoxide ion as they are to \nhydroxide or ethoxide ions, making phenoxide ions less \nlikely to re-form the undissociated molecules.\nAlternatively, we can explain the greater acidity of \nphenol by saying that phenol ionises to form a more  \nstable negative ion, so the ionisation of phenol is more \nlikely. This results in the position of equilibrium in the \nphenol equation in Table 25.3 lying further to the right-\nhand side (i.e. more molecules donating an H+ ion) than \nthe other equations.\nEthanol is a weaker acid than water because of the \nelectron-donating alkyl (ethyl) group attached to the \noxygen atom in the ethoxide ion. This has the effect of \nconcentrating more negative charge on this oxygen atom, \nwhich more readily accepts an H+ ion. This explains why \nthe position of equilibrium lies further to the left-hand \nside, favouring the undissociated ethanol molecules.\n\nQuestion\n7\t \u0007a\t \u0007Place the following molecules in order of their \nacidity, starting with the most acidic:\nCH3COOH   C6H5OH   HCl    C3H7OH   H2O\n\u0007b\t \u0007Would you expect methanol to be more or less \nacidic than phenol? Explain your answer.\nReactions of phenol\nWe can divide the reactions of phenol into those involving \nthe hydroxyl group, OH, and those involving substitution \ninto the benzene ring.\nBreaking of the OH bond in phenol\nAlthough phenol is only slightly soluble in water, it \ndissolves well in an alkaline solution. As you have just \nlearnt, phenol is a weak acid so it will react with an alkali \nto give a salt plus water:\n+  H2O\nOH + NaOH\nO–Na+\nThe salt formed, sodium phenoxide, is soluble in water.\nPhenol also reacts vigorously with sodium metal, giving \noff hydrogen gas and again forming sodium phenoxide:\nOH  +  2Na              2\nO–Na+  +  H2\n2\n⎯→\nSubstitution into the benzene ring  \nof phenol\nCompared with benzene, phenol reacts more readily \nwith electrophiles. The overlap of one of the lone pairs of \nelectrons on the oxygen atom in the OH group with the \nπ bonding system increases the electron density of the \nbenzene ring in phenol. This makes the benzene ring more \nopen to attack from electron-deficient electrophiles. It \n‘activates’ the benzene ring, especially at positions 2, 4  \nand 6 (see Table 25.4, page 390).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nBromination of phenol\nPhenol undergoes similar reactions to benzene, \nbut phenol does so under milder conditions. For \nexample, bromine water will not react with benzene \nat room temperature. To produce bromobenzene we \nneed pure bromine (not a solution) and an iron(III) \nbromide catalyst.\nHowever, bromine water reacts readily with phenol, \ndecolorising the orange solution and forming a white \nprecipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (see Figure 25.6):\nOH\nOH\nBr\nBr\n→\n+  3HBr\n+  3Br2\nBr\nSimilar reactions happen between phenol and chlorine  \nor iodine.\nThis activation of the benzene ring is also shown in \nthe nitration of phenol.

Vinegar is used as a preservative and in \ncooking. Other common carboxylic acids are citric acid, \nwhich gives citrus fruits their sharp taste, and ascorbic \nacid, which is the vitamin C in the same fruits.\nThe acidity of carboxylic acids\nCarboxylic acids display the typical reactions of all \nacids due to the presence of excess H+(aq) ions in their \naqueous solutions (see page 307). For example, they react \nwith bases to form a salt plus water. Their salts are called \ncarboxylates. The carboxylate salt formed by the reaction \nof ethanoic acid with sodium hydroxide is called sodium \nethanoate, CH3COO–Na+.\nThe carboxylic acids are weak acids. The majority of \ntheir molecules are undissociated in water. For example:\n394\nCH3COOH(aq)  \n  CH3COO–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n\t\nethanoic acid\t\nethanoate ion\nThe position of this equilibrium lies well over to the left-hand \nside. The dissociation constant, Ka, of ethanoic acid at 25 °C is \n1.7 × 10–5 mol dm–3 (see page 308). Remember that the smaller \nthe value of Ka, the weaker the acid.\nThe carboxylic acids are stronger acids than alcohols.\n■\n■\nThe O   H bond in the carboxylic acid is weakened by the \ncarbonyl group, C   O.\nelectrons in the C—O bond\nare drawn towards the C——O bond\nO\nelectrons are drawn away\nfrom the O—H bond\nR\nC\nO\nH\n■\n■\nThe carboxylate ion is stabilised by the delocalisation of \nelectrons around the  COO– group. This delocalisation \nspreads out the negative charge on the carboxylate ion, \nreducing its charge density and making it less likely to bond \nwith an H+(aq) ion to re-form the undissociated  \nacid molecule.\nnegative charge is spread over\nthe whole      COO– group (the bond\nlengths of both carbon–oxygen\nbonds are equal)\nO\n–\nR\nC\nO\n\nFigure 26.1  Vinegar \ncontains about 7% \nethanoic acid – a \ncarboxylic acid.\nElectron-withdrawing groups bonded to the carbon atom \nnext to the  COOH group make the acid stronger.

The carboxylic acids \nprepared are not usually oxidised any further.\nHowever, methanoic acid (HCOOH) is a stronger \nreducing agent than other carboxylic acids, so it can \nundergo further oxidation.\nO\nH\nH\nC\nO\nFigure 26.3  The displayed formula of methanoic acid.\nThis involves the oxidising agent breaking down the \nmethanoic acid molecule, forming carbon dioxide. This \noxidation can be carried out even by warming with mild \noxidising agents (such as the Fehling’s or Tollens’ reagents \nused to distinguish between aldehydes and ketones – see \npage 239).\nIn a positive test for an aldehyde, the Cu2+ ion in \nFehling’s solution is reduced to the Cu+ ion, which \nprecipitates out as red copper(I) oxide. When methanoic \nacid is oxidised by Fehling’s solution, the same positive \ntest result is obtained. With Tollens’ reagent, the silver ion \npresent, Ag+, is reduced to silver metal when it oxidises \nmethanoic acid (also as in the positive test for  \nan aldehyde).\nThe half-equation for the oxidation of methanoic acid \ncan be written in terms of electron transfer to an oxidising \nagent as:\n395\noxidation\n\t\n        HCOOH  \n  CO2  +  2H+(aq)  +  2e–\noxidation number\t\n+2\t\n+4\nor in terms of the addition of oxygen from an oxidising \nagent as:\nHCOOH  +  [O]  \n  CO2  +  H2O\nThis oxidation of methanoic acid will also occur with \nstronger oxidising agents such as acidified solutions of \npotassium manganate(VII) – decolorising the purple \nsolution – or potassium dichromate(VI) – turning the \norange solution green.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nAnother common example of a carboxylic acid that can  \nbe oxidised by these stronger oxidising agents is \nethanedioic acid (a dicarboxylic acid).

However, the synthetic reactions that are \nneeded can be difficult to do because carboxylic acids are \nquite unreactive. One way round this is to first convert  \nthe carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Acyl chlorides are \nmuch more reactive than carboxylic acids.\nAs we saw on page 396, an acyl chloride is similar \nin structure to a carboxylic acid, with the \n OH group \nreplaced by a Cl atom. So the \n COOH functional group \nis changed to the \n COCl group. The structural formula of \nacyl chlorides can be written as ROCl, where R is an alkyl \nor aryl group. For example, propanoyl chloride can be \nwritten as CH3CH2COCl.\nThe structural formulae of benzoic acid and its \nderivative benzoyl chloride are shown in Figure 26.5.\nCl\nO\nH\nO\nO\nC\nC\nderived from\nbenzoic acid\nbenzoyl chloride\nFigure 26.5  Benzoyl chloride is the acyl chloride derived from \nbenzoic acid.\nAcyl chlorides are reactive compounds. The carbonyl \ncarbon has electrons drawn away from it by the Cl atom as \nwell as by its O atom, and both are strongly electronegative \natoms. This gives the carbonyl carbon a relatively large \npartial positive charge and makes it particularly open to \nattack from nucleophiles.\nδ–\nO\nδ+\nC\nδ–\nCl\nThe acyl chlorides are reactive liquids. When they react \nwith nucleophiles the C   Cl bond breaks and white fumes \nof hydrogen chloride, HCl, are given off. To generalise \ntheir reactions, we can write:\nROCl  +  HZ  \n  ROZ  +  HCl\nwhere HZ can be water, an alcohol, ammonia or an amine. \nNotice that HZ contains either an oxygen or nitrogen atom \nwith a lone pair of electrons that can be donated. HZ can \ntherefore act as a nucleophile.\n\nChapter 26: Carboxylic acids and their derivatives\nHydrolysis of acyl chlorides\nWater is a suitable nucleophile to attack an acyl \nchloride molecule. A lone pair on the oxygen atom \nin water initiates the attack on the δ+ carbonyl \ncarbon atom. The reaction produces a carboxylic \nacid and hydrogen chloride. It is an example of \na hydrolysis reaction, i.e. the breakdown of a \ncompound by water.

The hydrolysis of \nchloroalkanes needs a strong alkali, such as aqueous \nsodium hydroxide, to be refluxed with the chloroalkane \nto hydrolyse it. The nucleophile needed to hydrolyse a \nchloroalkane is the negatively charged hydroxide ion, OH–. \nHowever, a neutral water molecule is sufficient to hydrolyse \nan acyl chloride quickly at room temperature. This \ndifference is due to the carbon bonded to the chlorine atom \nin a chloroalkane not being as strongly δ+ as the carbon \natom in an acyl chloride. Remember, in an acyl chloride \nthe carbon bonded to the chlorine atom is also attached\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nto an oxygen atom. It has two strongly electronegative \natoms pulling electrons away from it. Therefore the attack \nby the nucleophile is much more rapid.\nAryl chlorides, such as chlorobenzene, will not \nundergo hydrolysis. The carbon atom bonded to the \nchlorine atom is part of the delocalised π bonding system \nof the benzene ring. The p orbitals from the Cl atom tend \nto overlap with the delocalised p electrons in the benzene \nring.

Note that some primary \namines do not have the NH2 group at the end of an alkyl \nchain. We indicate the position of the NH2 group on the \nhydrocarbon chain by numbering from the nearest end of \nthe molecule. In these cases we refer to the NH2 group as \nthe ‘amino’ group, e.g. CH3CH2CH(NH2)CH2CH2CH3 is called \n3-aminohexane.\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nC\nC\nN\nH\nC\nN\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nCH3NH2\nmethylamine\nCH3CH2NH2\nethylamine\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nC\nC\nC\nN\nH\nH\nH\nH\npropylamine\nCH3CH2CH2NH2\nFigure 27.2  Three primary amines.\n\nChapter 27: Organic nitrogen compounds\nFigure 27.1  Doctor administering treatment for malaria.\n■\n■\nSecondary amines have two alkyl or aryl groups attached to \nan NH group, e.g. dimethylamine, (CH3)2NH (Figure 27.3).\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nC\nH\nC\nN\nH\nC\nH\nC\nN\n401\nH\nC\nH\nH\nH\nCH3NHCH3 or (CH3)2NH\ndimethylamine\n(a secondary amine)\n (CH3)3N\ntrimethylamine\n(a tertiary amine)\nH\nH\nH\nH\nFigure 27.3  A secondary amine and a tertiary amine.\n■\n■\nTertiary amines have three alkyl or aryl groups attached \nto the same nitrogen atom, e.g. trimethylamine, (CH3)3N \n(shown in Figure 27.3).\nThe basicity of amines\nWe can think of the amines as substituted ammonia \n(NH3) molecules. For example, a primary amine is an \nammonia molecule with one of its H atoms replaced by an \nalkyl or aryl group. Ammonia and the amines act as bases \nbecause of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. \nRemember that a base is a proton (H+ ion) acceptor. The \nnitrogen atom donates its lone pair to an H+ ion, forming a \nco-ordinate (dative) bond.\nFor ammonia:\nNH3  +  H+  \n  NH4\n+\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nFor a primary amine:\nRNH2  +  H+  \n  RNH3\n+\nDilute hydrochloric acid reacts with ammonia and with \namines to produce salts.\nFor ammonia:\nNH3  +  HCl  \n  NH4\n+Cl–\nammonium chloride\nFor a primary amine:\nCH3NH2  +  HCl  \n  CH3NH3\n+Cl–\nmethylammonium chloride\nAmmonia and the amines have different strengths as bases.\nThe strength of ammonia and amines as bases depends \non the availability of the lone pair of electrons on their N \natom to bond with an H+ ion.\nLet us consider ammonia, ethylamine and phenylamine  \nas examples. We find that the strongest base of the  \nthree is ethylamine, followed by ammonia and,  \nfinally, phenylamine.\n402\nethylamine    >    ammonia    >    phenylamine\n\t STRONGEST \t\nWEAKEST\n\t BASE                 \n\t\nBASE\nEthylamine is a stronger base than ammonia because \nthe ethyl group is electron-donating in nature (see \nFigure 27.4). By releasing electrons to the N atom, the ethyl \ngroup makes the lone pair more readily available to bond \nwith an H+ ion than it is in ammonia. Ammonia has three \nH atoms bonded to the N atom.\nalkyl groups are\nelectron-donating\n(or electron-releasing)\nCH3CH2\nNH2\nFigure 27.4  Ethylamine is a stronger base than ammonia.\nAmmonia is a stronger base than phenylamine because \none of the p orbitals on the nitrogen atom in phenylamine \noverlaps with the π bonding system in the benzene ring. \nThis causes the lone pair of the N atom in phenylamine to \nbe delocalised into the benzene ring. This then makes the\n\nlone pair less available to form a co-ordinate bond with an \nH+ ion than it is in ammonia (see Figure 27.5).\nnitrogen’s lone pair gets\ndrawn in to the delocalised\nring of electrons\nH\nN\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nN\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nFigure 27.5  Phenylamine is a very weak base.\nQuestion\n1\t \u0007a\t \u0007Name the following compounds:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2NH2\n\t\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007(CH3CH2CH2)2NH\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007C2H5NH3\n+Cl–\n\u0007b\t \u0007Predict whether diethylamine is a stronger  \nor weaker base than ethylamine. Explain  \nyour reasoning.\nFormation of amines\nMaking ethylamine\n1\t In Chapter 16 (page 218) you learnt how bromoethane \nundergoes nucleophilic substitution with ammonia \nto form a mixture of amines. In order to prepare \nethylamine (while avoiding the formation of secondary \nand tertiary amines and ammonium salts) we use \nexcess hot ethanolic ammonia:\nCH3CH2Br  +  NH3  \n  CH3CH2NH2  +  HBr\n\t\nethylamine\nHydrogen bromide, HBr, which could react with the \nethylamine, is removed by the excess ammonia. It forms \nammonium bromide, NH4Br. The excess ammonia also \nreduces the chances of bromoethane being attacked by \nethylamine; ethylamine is also a nucleophile.\n2\t We also learnt in Chapter 16 (pages 219–220) about \nthe formation of nitriles by reacting a halogenoalkane \nwith the CN– ion. To carry out the reaction, a solution \nof potassium cyanide, KCN, in ethanol is heated under \nreflux with the halogenoalkane:\nCH3Br\t  +  CN–  \n  CH3CN  +  Br–\nbromomethane\t\nethanenitrile\nNote that we start with bromomethane, not \nbromoethane, as the cyanide group adds a carbon atom \nto the alkyl group.

The nitrogen \nin the \n NH2 group in phenylamine has a lone pair of \nelectrons that can be delocalised into the benzene ring  \nso that the π bonding system extends to include the  \nC   N bond. The extra electron density in the benzene ring \nmakes it more readily attacked by electrophiles. Remember \nthat the 2, 4 and 6 positions around the benzene ring are \nactivated when electron-donating groups, such as \n NH2 \nor \n OH, are attached to the ring:\nNH2\nBr\nBr\nNH2\n+  3Br2\n+  3HBr\nBr\n2,4,6-tribromophenylamine\nThis reaction is called diazotisation. Note that the positive \ncharge on the diazonium ion (C6H5N2\n+) is on the nitrogen \natom shown with four bonds in the equation above.\nThe reaction mixture must be kept below 10 °C using \nice. This is because the diazonium salt is unstable and  \nwill decompose easily, giving off nitrogen gas, N2, at \nhigher temperatures.\n403\nDiazotisation\nPhenylamine is an important compound in the \nsynthesis of dyes. The first step is the reaction \nbetween phenylamine and nitrous acid (nitric(III) \nacid), HNO2, to give a diazonium salt. Nitrous \nacid is unstable, so it has to be made in the test \ntube, then the phenylamine added. We can make \nthe nitrous acid using sodium nitrite (sodium \nnitrate(III)) and dilute hydrochloric acid:\nNaNO2  +  HCl  \n  HNO2  +  NaCl\n\t\nnitrous acid\nThe first step in the synthesis of a dye is the \nproduction of benzenediazonium chloride:\nN\nNCl– + 2H2O\n+\nNH2 + HNO2 + HCl\nbenzenediazonium\nchloride\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nIn the second step, the diazonium ion reacts with an \nalkaline solution of phenol in a coupling reaction:\nN2\n+\n + \nOH + H+\nOH\nN\nN\nThe positively charged diazonium ion acts as an \nelectrophile. It substitutes into the benzene ring of phenol \nat the 4 position. An orange dye is formed, called an azo \ndye, or diazonium dye. The delocalised π bonding system \nextends between the two benzene rings through the NN \ngroup, which acts like a ‘bridge’. This makes the azo \ndye, called 4-hydroxyphenylazobenzene, very stable (an \nimportant characteristic of a good dye). The azo dye forms \nimmediately on addition of the phenol to the solution \ncontaining the diazonium ion (Figure 27.7).\n404\nFigure 27.7  The azo dye (also called a diazonium dye) forms \nin a coupling reaction between the diazonium ion and an \nalkaline solution of phenol.\nBy using alternative aryl compounds to phenol, we can \nmake a range of brightly coloured dyes.

One type of amino acid has the\nNH2 group bonded to the C atom next to the  COOH \ngroup. These 2-amino-carboxylic acids are the ‘building \nblocks’ that make up proteins.\nThe general structure of a 2-amino-carboxylic acid \nmolecule is shown in Figure 27.9.\nNH2\nR\nC\nH\nCOOH\nFigure 27.9  The general structure of a 2-amino-carboxylic acid.\nThe general structural formula of a 2-amino-carboxylic \nacid is RCH(NH2)COOH.\nThe R group is the part of the amino acid that can \nvary in different amino acids.

They are crystalline \nsolids that are soluble in water.\nA solution of amino acids contains zwitterions \nthat have both acidic and basic properties (i.e. they are \namphoteric). They will resist changes in pH when small \namounts of acid or alkali are added to them. Solutions that \ndo this are called buffer solutions (see pages 313–5).\nIf acid is added, the  COO– part of the zwitterion will \naccept an H+ ion, re-forming the undissociated  COOH \ngroup.

Therefore the reaction can continue, to form \na tripeptide initially, and then ever-longer chains of \namino acids. The longer molecules become known as \npolypeptides, and then proteins as they get even longer \nsequences of amino acids (see pages 413 and 415 in \nChapter 28).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n5\t \u0007The R groups in the 2-amino-carboxylic acids alanine \nand valine are  CH3 and (CH3)2HC  , respectively.\n\u0007a\t \u0007Draw the structures of both these amino acids.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Give an equation to show the formation of a \ndipeptide made from alanine and valine.\nReactions of the amides\nThe amide group is represented in structural formulae \nby CONH2.

Its displayed formula is:\nH\nO\nC\nH\nC\nH\nNH2\nethanamide\nUnlike the basic amines met at the start of this chapter, \nthe amides are neutral compounds. The presence of the \nelectron-withdrawing oxygen atom in the amide group \nmeans that the lone pair on an amide’s nitrogen atom is \nnot available to donate to electron deficient species, such  \nas H+ ions.\n406\nMaking an amide\nThe acyl chlorides are more reactive compounds than the \ncarboxylic acids they are made from (see page 397) and  \nare used for synthesising other useful compounds, such  \nas amides.\nEthanamide can be made by reacting ethanoyl chloride \nwith concentrated ammonia solution:\nCH3COCl  +  NH3   \n   CH3CONH2  +  HCl\nA primary amine, such as ethylamine, reacts with an acyl \nchloride to produce a substituted amide.\nC3H7COCl  +  C2H5NH2  \n  C3H7CONHC2H5  +  HCl\nBoth these reactions occur at room temperature, releasing \nwhite fumes of hydrogen chloride as soon as the reactants \nare added together. If there is an excess of the amine, \nit will react with the HCl formed to make its salt. For \nexample, in the previous reaction ethylamine will form \nethylammonium chloride, C2H5NH3\n+Cl–.\nThe italic letter N is used in naming substituted amides \nto denote which alkyl (or aryl) group or groups are bonded\n\nto the nitrogen atom. For example, in N-ethylbutanamide, \nC3H7CONHC2H5, the ethyl (C2H5\n) group has \nreplaced an H atom in the amide group. If the H atom \non the nitrogen in this molecule is replaced by another \nalkyl or aryl group, two N’s are used in the name, e.g. \nC3H7CON(C2H5)2 is called N,N-diethylbutanamide.\nHydrolysis of amides\nThe characteristic  CONH— group in substituted amides \nlinks the two hydrocarbon sections of their molecules \ntogether. This link can be broken by hydrolysis with an \nacid or an alkali.

The amine formed will react with excess acid \nin the reaction vessel to make its ammonium salt, e.g. \nR2NH3\n+Cl– with excess hydrochloric acid.\nWith an alkali, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, \nthe products are the sodium salt of the carboxylic acid \n(R1COO–Na+) and the primary amine (R2NH2).\nIf we reflux an unsubstituted amide (RCONH2)  \nwith acid, the products are the corresponding carboxylic \nacid and ammonia. The ammonia in solution reacts  \nwith excess acid to make an ammonium salt. With an \nalkali, the products are the salt of the carboxylic acid  \nand ammonia.\nQuestion\n6\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write an equation to show the formation of the \nfollowing compounds using an acid chloride:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007propanamide\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007N-ethylpropanamide.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Write an equation to show the hydrolysis of:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007butanamide by refluxing with dilute \nhydrochloric acid\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007N-ethylbutanamide by refluxing with aqueous \nsodium hydroxide.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nElectrophoresis\nHow electrophoresis works\nElectrophoresis is used extensively in biochemical \nanalysis.

A buffer \nsolution carries the ions along. The rate at which the ions \nmove towards the oppositely charged electrode depends, \namong other things, on the size and charge on the ions: \nlarger ions will move more slowly; highly charged ions \nwill move more quickly. Therefore the ions are separated \nas the electric field is applied.

You have \nmet addition polymerisation reactions in  \nChapter 15. In this chapter you will find out more \nabout another type of polymerisation reaction \ncalled condensation polymerisation.\nCondensation polymerisation\nIn Chapter 27 (page 405) we saw how amino acids can \nreact together to form peptides. The reaction is called a \ncondensation reaction. We can think of it as an addition \nreaction (in which reactant molecules bond to each  \nother), followed by an elimination reaction (in which a  \nsmall molecule is released). For example, the following  \nequation shows how three amino acid molecules can react \nto make a tripeptide:\n412\nR\nR\nR\nC\nH2N\nCOOH\n+\n+\nC\nH2N\nCOOH\nC\nH2N\nCOOH\nH\nH\nH\namino acid\nR\nO\nO\nR\nR\nC\nH2N\n2H2O\nC\nN\nN\nC\nC\n+\nC\nCOOH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\na tripeptide\nA large protein molecule, formed by condensation \npolymerisation, can contain thousands of amino acid \nmonomers.

This occurs in two ways:\n–\t\nthe two different functional groups are found within \nthe same molecule, as in amino acids; each amino acid \nmonomer molecule has an \n  NH2 functional group and \na \n COOH functional group\n–\t\nthe two different functional groups are found in two \ndifferent molecules; for example, nylon 6,6 is made from \ntwo different monomers – one monomer has two \n  NH2 \nfunctional groups and the other monomer has two\nCOOH functional groups.\n■\n■\nCondensation polymerisation also leads to the formation of \nsmall molecules such as H2O or HCl.\nquestion\n1\t \u0007a\t \u0007Which of these monomers form addition polymers \nand which form condensation polymers?\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007NH2CH(CH3)COOH\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007H2C     CHC6H5\n\t\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007H2C     CHCOOH\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iv\t \u0007NH2CH2COOH\n\u0007\t\n\u0007v\t \u0007CH3CH(OH)COOH\n\u0007b\t \u0007Explain the basis of your decisions in part a.\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007Write an equation to show the polymerisation \nreaction between propene molecules.\n\u0007ii\t \u0007What type of polymerisation reaction is shown \nin part c i?\n\u0007iii\t \u0007What is the repeat unit of poly(propene)?\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nSynthetic polyamides\nProteins have their monomers bonded to each other \nvia peptide links (also called amide links in synthetic \npolymers such as nylons). This means that polypeptides \nand proteins are types of polyamide.\nFor the last 80 years, chemists have used condensation \npolymerisation to make synthetic polyamides. Nylon \nis a polyamide. Nylon can be made from a variety of \nmonomers, but all nylons are made in reactions between \nthe amine group (\n NH2) and a carboxylic acid  \n(\n  COOH) or acyl chloride group (\n  COCl).\nFor example, 1,6-diaminohexane reacts with \nhexanedioic acid to make nylon 6,6:\nOH\nO\natoms lost to form water\n(CH2)4\nC\nC\nH\nH HO\nO\n(CH2)6\nN\nN\nH\nH\nO\nH\n(CH2)4\nC\nC\n+\nH2O\n(CH2)6\nN\nN\nO n\nH\namide link\nor peptide link\nThe numbers used in nylon 6,6 refer to the number of \ncarbon atoms in each monomer unit.\nHexanedioyl dichloride, ClOC(CH2)4COCl, can be \nused as a more reactive, but more expensive, monomer \nthan hexanedioic acid.\nNylon 6 is the only example of a nylon polymer that \nis not formed by a condensation reaction; instead it is \nmade from the compound caprolactam, which is a cyclic \namide. When heated in an atmosphere of nitrogen the ring \nbreaks open at the amide group. The resulting chains join \ntogether to make nylon 6 (Figure 28.2).\nO\nO\n→\nn\nN\nH\nN\nH\nn\ncaprolactam\nFigure 28.2  Nylon 6 is not formed by condensation \npolymerisation as no small molecule is given off. The reaction \nis called ‘ring-opening’ polymerisation.\n\nChapter 28: Polymerisation\nNote that caprolactam is made from 6-aminohexanoic \nacid, with its NH2 group and COOH group at either end of \nthe molecule. They react with each other in a condensation \nreaction, releasing water. It is easier to visualise the \nformation of nylon 6 as the condensation polymerisation \nof 6-aminohexanoic acid (which would follow the  \nusual pattern of condensation polymerisation to form  \na polyamide).\nNylon’s low density, its strength and its elasticity \nmake it a very useful fibre in the clothing industry. \nThese properties also make it ideal for climbing ropes \n(Figure 28.3). During the manufacturing process, the \nnylon is forced out of nozzles and pulled into long fibres. \nThis is called ‘cold drawing’. It lines up the nylon polymer \nchains along the length of the fibre. Strong hydrogen \nbonds form between neighbouring chains, accounting for \nnylon’s high tensile strength and elasticity.\n413\nFigure 28.3  Climbers rely on nylon’s elasticity and high \ntensile strength to minimise the effects of a fall.\nKevlar®\nKevlar is a polyamide, containing benzene rings. It is very \nstrong, but flexible. It is also resistant to fire and abrasion. \nIt has these properties because of its structure.\nIts long, linear polymer chains can line up next to \neach other in a regular pattern. This results in extensive \nhydrogen bonding between the polymer chains of Kevlar®.\nThe formula and structure of Kevlar® is shown in  \nFigure 28.4.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\na\nb\nO\nO\nC\nN\nC\nN\nO\nn\nH\nH\nC\nO\nC\nO\nC\nFigure 28.4  a  The formula showing the repeat of Kevlar®. b  The hydrogen bonding between chains of the polyamide.

In \nreality, the base pairs on each strand are not completely in line \nwith each other; rather they are slightly twisted out of line. \nThis allows the DNA double helix to be able to bend, rather \nthan being a straight rod-like structure.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nP\nP\nA\nT\nCH2\nP\nP\nCH2\nG\nC\nCH2\nO\nO\nFigure 28.17  The detailed structure of part of a DNA molecule, \nshowing the hydrogen bonding between the base pairs.\nquestions\n420\nold hydrogen\nbonds broken\nP\nnucleotide\ntriphosphate\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\npyrophosphates\nreleased\nnew hydrogen\nbonds form\ncomplementary\nstrands being made\nFigure 28.18  A strand of DNA acting as template for replication.\n\nHow DNA replicates\nThe chromosomes in the cell nucleus contain DNA. The \nDNA in almost every cell in our body is identical. When \na cell divides, both the new cells need a complete copy of \nall of this DNA because DNA contains the information for \nall the cell’s activities. The information is provided by the \nsequence of bases in DNA. The process of copying DNA \nduring cell division is called replication.\nReplication is a complex process requiring a number of \ndifferent enzymes and other compounds. Although you do \nnot need to explain this process in detail, it is interesting \nto see how it works.

The most common polyester fibre is Terylene®. \nTerylene® is made from benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid and \nethane-1,2-diol.

Its \nnon-polar polymer chains interact with each other by van \nder Waals’ forces. As the chains are heavily branched, not \nstraight chains, these intermolecular forces are relatively \nweak for such large molecules. The random branching \nmakes it impossible for the polymer chains to pack neatly \ntogether and accounts for its low density and low melting \ntemperature (see Figure 28.20).\nThen in the 1950s a chemist called Karl Ziegler \ndiscovered a catalyst that helped produce poly(ethene) \nconsisting of straight chains, showing that reaction \nconditions can affect the nature of the polymer formed. \nThis new type of poly(ethene) had different properties.  \nIts unbranched polymer chains could pack closely  \ntogether (see Figure 28.21) and formed high-density \npoly(ethene) (HDPE).\n422\nFigure 28.20  The branched chains of LDPE. The van der Waals’ \nforces between the non-polar polymer chains are affected not \nonly by the size of the chains but also their inability to pack \nclosely together, reducing the effectiveness of instantaneous \ndipoles in one chain to induce dipoles on neighbouring chains.\nFigure 28.21  The unbranched chains of HDPE can pack \nclosely together in regions of regular patterns, increasing \nthe surface area of contact between neighbouring chains \nresulting in stronger van der Waals’ forces being set up \nbetween chains.\n\nThis is a much stronger plastic and has a higher melting \ntemperature. Therefore HDPE can be used to make \nwater pipes and containers that can be sterilised with \nboiling water. This demonstrates the importance of the \nintermolecular forces between polymer chains when \nconsidering the properties of polymeric materials.\nAnother example of this is the difference in properties \nbetween natural rubber and synthetic rubbers. From the \n1930s, chemists have tried to mimic natural polymers. \nFinding synthetic substitutes for rubber and silk, for \nexample, offered the chance to produce cheaper materials \nwith improved properties. Neoprene, a synthetic rubber, \nand nylon, a synthetic polyamide, were both products \ndiscovered at that time. Neoprene was made from the \npolymerisation of the monomer 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene in \nan addition reaction:\nThe monomer of natural rubber is 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, \nwhich is very similar to the monomer for neoprene. The \nintermolecular forces between natural rubber polymers \nare van der Waals’ forces. A process called vulcanisation \nwas invented to make rubber tyres more resilient and \nhardwearing. This links rubber polymer chains by \ncovalent bonds across ‘sulfur bridges’ (Figure 28.22).\nquestion\n9\t \u0007a\t \u0007The word ‘resilient’ means to return to the original \nform or position after being bent, compressed or \nstretched.

The \nsolvent used is often the ester, ethyl ethanoate, as it has a \nlow toxicity and is volatile. However, it is flammable and \nother organic solvents used in adhesives are harmful to \nhealth. Therefore chemists have developed glues that do \nnot rely on organic solvents that are a source of pollution.\nThe main component of non-solvent-based adhesives \nis often a polymer that contains silicon bonded to oxygen. \nThey set (or cure) by reacting with the moisture present \nin air. The water hydrolyses the silicon–oxygen parts of \nthe polymer chain, which form cross-linkages between \neach other. This effectively bonds the polymer chains \nto each other with strong covalent bonds. The cross-\nlinking siloxane grouping is \n  Si     O     Si  \n , which is \nthe equivalent of an ether functional group in carbon \nchemistry (see Figure 28.23).\n2RSi(OCH3)2R’  +  H2O → [RSi(OCH3)R’]2O  +  2CH3OH\nThe polymers are called ‘silyl modified polymers’ (SMPs) \nand are non-toxic and environmentally friendly, and they \nset quickly.

The use \nof degradable plastics is becoming more common as \npeople start to realise the issues related to the disposal \nof polyalkenes as a result of their non-biodegradability \ncaused by their lack of reactivity (see page 212). Here are \ntwo developments to help solve the disposal problem: \nbiodegradable plastics and photodegradable plastics.\nBiodegradable plastics\nSome plastics, when buried for many years, eventually \nbecome brittle and break down into smaller pieces that can \nbe decomposed naturally by microorganisms in soil. If the \nsurface area of the plastic being buried could be increased, \nthen it could degrade much more quickly. Scientists have \ndeveloped plastics that contain small amounts of starch \ngranules that the bacteria and fungi in moist soil can break \ndown. So the plastic is broken into smaller pieces, with \na larger surface area for decomposition to occur faster. \nOther plastics are now made from monomers derived \ndirectly from plant materials, such as PLA, which soil \nmicroorganisms can digest easily (Figure 28.27).\nIn polyamides, such as nylon, the amide links, \n \n  CO     NH    , can be broken down by hydrolysis in \nacidic conditions found in land-fill waste dumps with \nrotting vegetation. You can see the hydrolysis reaction  \non page 406, in which carboxylic acids and amines  \nare formed.\nIn polyesters, the ester links are similarly broken down \nby acid hydrolysis, forming alcohols and carboxylic acids\n\nChapter 28: Polymerisation\nFigure 28.27  Chemists are devising plastics that can be \nbroken down by microorganisms in soil or by light.\n(see page 229). This susceptibility to hydrolysis makes both \npolyamides and polyesters biodegradable, unlike the non-\nbiodegradable polyalkenes.\nPhotodegradable plastics\nPolymer chains also have been designed that incorporate \ncarbonyl groups (C     O) at intervals down their length. \nThese carbonyl groups absorb energy from the ultraviolet \nregion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This causes the \nbonds in the region of the carbonyl group to weaken \nand break down. As the polymer breaks into smaller \nfragments, the plastic will biodegrade much more quickly \nif it is not chemically inert.\nThere is some debate as to whether photodegradable \nplastics are better for the environment or not. In a land-\nfill site, the plastic waste is often buried under other \nrubbish and eventually soil – so there is no light available \nto trigger the breakdown of the polymer chains. They also \nmake recycling plastics problematic, as they could weaken \na recycled mixture of different plastics when it is put to a  \nnew use.\n425\nConducting polymers\nMost polymers are electrical insulators, which makes them \nvery useful for making plugs, sockets and light switches. \nHowever, a group of polymers have been developed that \ncan conduct electricity. One of the first was the polymer \nformed from the hydrocarbon called ethyne (also still \nknow by its old name, acetylene). Its molecular formula is \nC2H2 and its displayed formula is:\nH    C     C  \n H\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nH\nH +\nC\nethyne\nC\n+ H\nH\nC\nC\n+ H\nH\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nC\netc\netc\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\ntrans-poly (ethyne)\nFigure 28.28  The polymerisation of ethyne (acetylene) to \nform a conducting polymer.\nWe can represent the formation of poly(ethyne) from its \nethyne monomers as shown in Figure 28.28.\nAs drawn in Figure 28.28, the poly(ethyne) is in the \ntrans- configuration as opposed to the cis- form of the \npolymer. Figure 28.29 shows how to represent both forms. \nA polymer chain with mixture of cis- and trans- sections \ncan be made by varying the reaction conditions.\nNote the alternate double and single carbon–carbon \nbonds in poly(ethyne). It can conduct electricity because \nits π bonding spreads down the length of the polymer \nchain. The overlapping p orbitals on neighbouring carbon \natoms result in long bands of delocalised electrons that are \nfree to move along the length of the polymer chains (see \npages 80 and 383).\nLots of research has been carried out to produce other \nconducting polymers with extended π bonding systems. \nPoly(ethyne) and some other examples are shown by their \nskeletal formulae in Figure 28.29.\n426\nConducting polymers usually have other substances, \nsuch as iodine, added to improve their electrical \nconductivity. This is called ‘doping’. They have a number \nof advantages over the metal conductors that they can \npotentially replace. They do not corrode, are much less \ndense, and can be shaped more easily.

It is used to separate mixtures as a \nsolvent moves up a piece of absorbent paper. We call the \nsolvent the mobile phase, and water trapped between the \ncellulose fibres of the paper is the stationary phase. The \nsubstances in the mixture will have different affinities for \nthe solvent and for the water, and so they move at different \nrates over the paper (Figure 29.2).\nThe Rf values (retardation factors) of substances are \ncalculated as shown in Figure 29.3. The conditions must be \nidentical to those quoted in the Rf data table, e.g. the same \ntemperature and the same solvent used.\nColoured substances can be seen directly on the \npaper but others are sprayed with a chemical that \nforms coloured compounds on the chromatogram. For \nexample, amino acids can be revealed as bluish spots by \nninhydrin spray.\nIntroduction\nWe can detect and identify any chemical \nsubstance using a range of different techniques. \nSpecialised instruments have been developed \nto carry out tests, such as gas-liquid \nchromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance \n(NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.

This means \nthat their spots on the paper chromatogram will overlap \nand separation will be poor. This can happen when we \nhydrolyse a protein and try to identify the amino acid \nresidues present. This is when two-way chromatography is \nuseful. In this technique, paper chromatography is carried \nout as normal but then the chromatogram produced \nis rotated by 90° and re-run in a different solvent. It is \nunlikely that the Rf values will coincide in two different \nsolvents, so separation takes place (Figure 29.4).\nMaking a two-way paper chromatogram\n1st solvent front\n2nd solvent front\n2nd solvent front\ntwo solutes\noverlapping\n1st solvent front\nrotate paper\nthrough 90°\nthree solutes now\ncompletely separated\noriginal\nmixture\nmixture of\nthree solutes\nFigure 29.4  Two-way paper chromatography to separate \nsolutes with similar Rf values in a solvent.

The mobile \nphase is the solvent chosen. The other solvent is the water \ntrapped in the paper’s structure, which is the stationary \nphase. Figure 29.5 shows solute molecules partitioned \nbetween the mobile phase and a stationary liquid phase on \na solid support.\nThe solutes in the mixture being separated are \npartitioned to different extents between the solvents  \nin the mobile and stationary phases.

This is then put into an \noven, where it dries out into a solid white coating on the \nglass.

Therefore they travel more slowly \nup the thin layer of alumina or silica, and separation \noccurs. Solutes are located on the chromatogram and \nidentified by comparing with standard known substances \nor by calculating Rf values.\n\nNote that although TLC is normally described as \nadsorption chromatography, some partitioning does \noccur if water is present. Both dried alumina and silica \ncan become rehydrated. When this happens, water also \nacts as a partitioning stationary phase together with the \nadsorbing stationary solid phase.\nTLC is quicker than paper chromatography and  \ncan be used on smaller samples, making it useful in \nforensic science, where it can be used to identify drugs  \nand explosive residues.

The stationary phase is a non-\nvolatile liquid, such as a long-chain hydrocarbon liquid, \nbonded onto a solid support, e.g. small particles of silica. \nThis is packed tightly into a column. The solvent chosen \nfor the mobile phase is usually polar, e.g. a methanol/water \nsolvent. This has to be forced under pressure through \nthe densely packed column where separation occurs \n(Figure 29.8).\nThe tiny solid particles in the column have a very large \nsurface area over which partitioning can occur, resulting \nin excellent separation. The more polar components in \nthe mixture have a greater relative solubility in the polar \nsolvent. Therefore they are carried through the column \nfaster than components whose molecules are more non-\npolar (which dissolve better in the non-polar stationary \nphase in the column).

The nucleus of a hydrogen atom consists of a \nsingle proton. This proton can spin. The spinning motion \nof the positively charged proton causes a very small \nmagnetic field to be set up.\nIn NMR we put the sample to be analysed in a \nmagnetic field. The hydrogen nuclei (protons) either line \nup with the field or, by spinning in the opposite direction, \nline up against it (Figure 29.13).\nThere is a tiny difference in energy between the \noppositely spinning 1H nuclei. This difference corresponds \nto the energy carried by waves in the radiowave range \nof the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. In NMR \nspectroscopy the nuclei ‘flip’ between the two energy \nlevels (Figure 29.14). Only atoms whose mass number is an \nodd number, e.g. 1H or 13C, absorb energy in the range of \nfrequencies that are analysed.\nThe size of the gap between the nuclear energy levels \nvaries slightly, depending on the other atoms in the \nmolecule (the molecular environment). Therefore, NMR \ncan be used to identify 1H atoms in different parts of \na molecule. This is easier to visualise by looking at an \nexample. If we look at a molecule of methanol, CH3OH, we \ncan see that there are 1H atoms in two different molecular \nenvironments. We have the 1H atoms in the  CH3 group \nand the 1H atom in the  OH group. The energy absorbed \nby the  CH3 1H atoms is different from the energy \nabsorbed by the 1H atoms in  OH.\nIn NMR spectroscopy, we vary the magnetic field as \nthat is easier than varying the wavelength of radiowaves. \nAs the magnetic field is varied, the 1H nuclei in different\nH\nnucleus\nH\nnucleus\nFigure 29.13  Hydrogen \n(1H) nuclei will line up \nwith or against an applied \nmagnetic field.\nthis nucleus\nis lined up with\nthe applied ﬁeld\n\nChapter 29: Analytical chemistry\nthis small diﬀerence in energy\nlies in the radiowave range\n‘against’\nEnergy\nbefore ﬁeld\nis applied\nafter ﬁeld is applied\n‘with’\nFigure 29.14  Hydrogen (1H) nuclei will absorb energy in the \nradiowave range when they ‘flip’ from the lower energy level, \nlining up with the applied magnetic field, to the higher energy \nlevel, lining up against it.\nmolecular environments flip at different field strengths. \nThe different field strengths are measured relative to a \nreference compound, which is given a value of zero. The \nstandard compound chosen is tetramethylsilane (TMS). \nTMS is an inert, volatile liquid that mixes well with \nmost organic compounds. Its formula is Si(CH3)4, so all \nits H atoms are equivalent (i.e. they are all in the same \nmolecular environment). TMS only gives one, sharp \nabsorption, called a peak, and this peak is at a higher \nfrequency than most other protons (Figure 29.15). All \nother absorptions are measured by their shift away from \nthe TMS line on the NMR spectrum. This is called the \nchemical shift (δ), and is measured in units of parts per \nmillion (ppm).\n439\nsingle peak\nof TMS\n(which we use\nas a standard)\n0\nchemical\nshift (δ)\nFigure 29.15  The standard TMS peak used as a reference on \nNMR spectra.\ndirection of\nmagnetic ﬁeld\napplied in\nNMR spectrometer\nthis nucleus\nis lined up against\nthe applied ﬁeld\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nquestion\n4\t \u0007a\t \u0007Explain why tetramethylsilane (TMS) is used as a \nstandard in NMR spectroscopy.\n\u0007b\t \u0007In NMR we use solvents such as \ntetrachloromethane to prepare samples for the \nmachine (Figure 29.16).\n440\nFigure 29.16  Samples dissolved in a solvent in narrow \ntubes ready for NMR analysis.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007What is the molecular formula of \ntetrachloromethane?\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007Why do you think tetrachloromethane is used \nas a solvent?\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007Solvents that contain deuterium, D, are also \nused as solvents in NMR.

Why \nwould the deuterated solvent CDCl3 be used \ninstead of CHCl3?\n\nLow-resolution NMR\nA low-resolution NMR spectrum shows a single peak for \neach non-equivalent hydrogen atom; an example is shown \nin Figure 29.17.\nNote how the zero point on the x-axis, chemical shift \n(δ), is on the right of the spectrum and the shift increases \nin value going left.\nThere are three peaks on ethanol’s low-resolution \nNMR spectrum. These correspond to the 1H atoms in \n OH,  CH2\n and  CH3. Note how the heights of the \npeaks vary. The area under each peak tells us the relative \nnumber of equivalent 1H atoms responsible for that \nparticular chemical shift. The largest peak will be from \nthe  CH3 hydrogen atoms, the middle peak from the \n CH2\n  hydrogen atoms and the smallest peak from the \n OH hydrogen. The relative areas under the peaks are \nshown on the NMR spectrum by the labels 1H, 2H and 3H \n(Figure 29.17).\nThe type of H atom present can be checked against \ntables of data (Table 29.1) if you are using NMR to identify \nunknown organic compounds.\nUsing Table 29.1 we can see that the peak at about 1.2 ppm \nis caused by the   CH3 hydrogen atoms (range 0.7–1.6 ppm), \nthe peak at about 3.7 ppm corresponds to   CH2   hydrogen \natoms (range 3.3–4.3 ppm) and the peak at about 5.4 ppm is \ndue to the   OH hydrogen atom.\n3H\nAbsorption of energy\n2H\n1H\nδ/ ppm\n7.0\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\nFigure 29.17  The low-resolution NMR spectrum of \nethanol, CH3CH2OH.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nType of proton\nChemical shift, δ / ppm\nR   CH3\n0.7–1.6\nN   H\t\nR   OH\n1.0–5.5(a)\nR   CH2   R\n1.2–1.4\nR3CH\n1.6–2.0\nO\nRCH2\nC\nO\nH3C\nC\nCH2R\nCH3\nN   CH3\t\nN   CH2R\t\nN   CHR2\n2.3–2.9\nO   CH3\t\nO   CH2R\t\nO   CHR2\n3.3–4.3\nBr or Cl   CH3\t\nBr or Cl   CH2R\t\nBr or Cl   CHR2\n3.0–4.2\nCH   CH   \n45.–6.0\nO\nC\nNH2\nO\nO\nH\nC\n9.0–10\nO\nH\nC\n11.0–12.0(a)\nquestion\n5\t \u0007Predict the number of peaks and the relative areas \nunder each peak, where appropriate, on the low-\nresolution proton NMR spectrum of:\n\u0007a\t \u0007methanol, CH3OH\t\n\u0007d\t\n\u0007propan-1-ol\n\u0007b\t \u0007benzene, C6H6\t\n\u0007e\t\n\u0007propan-2-ol\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007chloroethane, C2H5Cl\t\n\u0007f\t\n\u0007propanone.\n\nChapter 29: Analytical chemistry\nO\nR2CH\nC\n2.0–2.9\nCHR2\n2.3–2.7\nOH\n4.5–10.0(a)\nNH\nC\n5.0–12.0(a)\n441\nH\n6.5–8.0\nTable 29.1  1H NMR chemical shifts relative to TMS. Chemical shifts are typical values that can vary slightly depending on the \nsolvent, concentration and substituents. (a)OH and NH chemical shifts are very variable (sometimes outside these limits and are \noften broad. Signals are not usually seen as split peaks).\nHigh-resolution NMR\nAs you can see in Table 29.1, the chemical shifts are given over \nranges, and the ranges for different types of hydrogen atoms \ndo overlap. In some molecules where there is heavy shielding \nof the hydrogen nuclei by lots of electrons in surrounding \natoms, peaks are shifted beyond their usual range. In such \ncases high-resolution NMR is useful. High-resolution NMR \ngives us more information to interpret. Peaks that appear \nas one ‘signal’ on a low-resolution NMR spectrum are often \nrevealed to be made up of a cluster of closely grouped peaks. \nThis is because the magnetic fields generated by spinning \nnuclei interfere slightly with those of neighbouring nuclei.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nThis interference is called spin–spin coupling. The exact \nsplitting pattern of a peak depends on the number of \nhydrogen atoms on the adjacent carbon atom or atoms.\nThe number of signals a peak splits into equals n + 1 \nwhere n is the number of 1H atoms on the adjacent  \ncarbon atom.\nThe high-resolution NMR spectrum of ethanol illustrates this \nn + 1 rule used to interpret splitting patterns (Figure 29.18).\n■\n■\nThe    CH3 peak is split into three because there are two 1H \natoms on the adjacent CH2 group. n + 1 = 3 (as n = 2); this is \ncalled a triplet.\n■\n■\nThe    CH2\n peak is split into four because there are three\n1H atoms on the adjacent    CH3 group. n + 1 = 4 (as n = 3); \nthis is called a quartet.\n■\n■\nThe    OH peak is not usually split as its 1H atom is \nconstantly being exchanged with the 1H atoms of other \nethanol molecules and any water present.

As we have seen on \npage 442, the peak is not split by the 1H atoms (protons) \non the neighbouring  CH2   group. The reason for this is \nthat the  OH proton exchanges very rapidly with protons \nin any traces of water (or acid) present, as follows:\nCH3CH2OH  +  H2O  \n  CH3CH2OH  +  HOH\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nThe hydrogen atoms involved in this reversible proton \nexchange have been coloured red and blue. The exchange takes \nplace so rapidly that the signal for the    OH protons becomes \na single peak. This exchange also happens in amines and \namides which contain the  NH   group.\nTable 29.3 shows the chemical shift ranges for the \ndifferent    OH and \n NH   signals.\nDifferent OH and NH protons\nRange of chemical \nshift (δ) / ppm\nin alcohols, R   OH protons\n1.0–5.5\nin phenols, arene   OH protons\n6.5–7.0\nin carboxylic acids, R   COOH protons\n11.0–11.7\nin amines,    NH2 /    NH    \n1.0–5.5\nin aryl amines, arene    NH2 \n3.0–6.0\nin amides,    CONH2  ,    CONH   \n5.0–12.0\nTable 29.3  Chemical shift ranges for \n OH and \n NH   \nprotons in different molecular environments.\nAs you can see from Table 29.1 (page 441), these ranges \noverlap with the chemical shifts of other types of \nproton. The signals can also appear outside the quoted \nranges under certain conditions, e.g. choice of solvent \nor concentration. This makes NMR spectra difficult to \ninterpret. However, there is a technique for positively \nidentifying    OH or \n NH   groups in a molecule. \nTheir peaks ‘disappear’ from the spectra if you add a \nsmall amount of deuterium oxide, D2O, to the sample. \nThe deuterium atoms (2H) in D2O, called ‘heavy water’, \nexchange reversibly with the protons in the    OH or\n444\nNH   groups. For example:\nOH  +  D2O  \n  \n OD  +  HOD\nNH   CO     +  D2O  \n  \n ND   CO     +  HOD\nThe deuterium atoms do not absorb in the same region \nof the electromagnetic spectrum as protons (1H atoms). \nThis makes the  OH or NH signal disappear from the NMR \nspectrum. By checking against the peaks in the original NMR \nspectrum, without D2O, we can tell if the    OH or    NH\ngroups are present in the sample. The 1H atom in the    OH or\nNH   group is referred to as a ‘labile’ proton.\n\nquestion\n7\t \u0007a\t \u0007Look back to Figure 29.18 on page 442. The high-\nresolution NMR spectrum shown is from a sample \nof ethanol containing traces of water. How would \nthe NMR spectrum differ if D2O had been added to \nthe sample of ethanol?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Look back to Question 6. How would repeating  \nthe NMR analysis using a solvent of D2O be able to \nhelp the pathologist distinguish between aspirin \nand paracetamol?\nCarbon-13 NMR spectroscopy\nIn addition to proton NMR. carbon-13 NMR is another \nanalytical tool used frequently by organic chemists. The \nvast majority of carbon atoms in any organic compound \nwill be the carbon-12 isotope. This isotope has an even \nmass number (12). Therefore it has no signal on an NMR \nspectrum, as NMR only works with atoms with an odd \nmass number (such as 1H, as we have already seen). \nHowever, about 1% of the carbon atoms in any sample of \nan organic compound will be the carbon-13 isotope. Its \nnuclei will interact with the magnetic field applied in NMR \nanalysis so can produce a NMR spectrum.\nCarbon-13 NMR produces a spectrum with different \nchemical shifts for non-equivalent carbon atoms in a \nmolecule. Typical carbon-13 NMR shifts are shown in \nTable 29.4. As in proton NMR, the chemical shifts are \nmeasured with reference to the TMS peak at 0 ppm on the \nspectrum (see page 439).\nAnalysis of carbon-13 NMR spectra is similar to that \nof proton NMR, looking to match different chemical shifts \nto characteristic molecular environments. However, the \nsignals produced in carbon-13 NMR appear as discrete \nvertical lines on the spectra (without the complication of \nthe splitting patterns caused by the protons in 1H atoms \nwithin the molecules). Take care in interpreting the \ncarbon-13 NMR spectra because the heights of the lines \nare not usually proportional to the number of equivalent \n13C atoms present.\nThe solvent used to prepare samples for 13C NMR \nanalysis is CDCl3. This accounts for the small signal near \n80 ppm that can be ignored when interpreting a spectrum, \nas it is caused by the atoms of 13C in the solvent molecules.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nsp3\nnext to chlorine (  CH2    Br and\nCH2   I are in the same range \nas alkyl)\nsp2\nalkene or arene\nTable 29.4  Typical 13C chemical shift values (δ) relative to TMS = 0.

The mass spectrum of an element \ncan be used to measure relative isotopic masses and \ntheir relative abundances. This information is used to \ncalculate relative atomic masses. However, the main \nuse of mass spectrometry is in the identification of \norganic compounds. As in other forms of spectroscopy, \na substance can be identified by matching its spectrum \nagainst the spectra of known substances stored in a \ndatabase. This technique is known as ‘fingerprinting’.\nIn a mass spectrometer the sample is first vaporised. \nWhen vapour from the sample enters the machine it \nis bombarded by high-energy electrons. This knocks \nelectrons from the molecules and breaks covalent bonds, \nfragmenting the molecule. Figure 29.23 shows the mass \nspectrum produced by propanone.\n446\n100\n43\nRelative abundance (%)\n80\n60\n58\n40\n20\n15\n0\n20\n0\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMass-to-charge ratio (m/e)\nFigure 29.23  The mass spectrum of propanone.\n\nThe peak at the highest mass-to-charge ratio is caused by \nthe molecular ion (M+). This ion is formed by the sample \nmolecule with one electron knocked out. It gives us the relative \nmolecular mass of the sample. We can assume the  \nions detected carry a single positive charge, so the reading  \non the horizontal axis gives us the mass. In the case of \npropanone, CH3COCH3, the molecular ion has a relative  \nmass of 58.0. This corresponds to CH3COCH3\n+, with a mass  \nof (3 × 12.0) + (1 × 16.0) + (6 × 1.0).\nWe also get large peaks at 15 and 43 on the mass \nspectrum. These peaks are due to fragments that are \nproduced when propanone molecules are broken apart \nby the electron bombardment. Knowing the structure \nof propanone we should be able to identify the fragment \nresponsible for each peak (Figure 29.24).\nFigure 29.24  The fragmentation of propanone: +CH3 causes \nthe peak at 15 and CH3C+O causes the peak at 43.\nThe electron bombardment has caused the C   C single \nbonds in the propanone molecules to break. This has \nresulted in the fragments at m/e 15 and 43 that are \nobserved in Figure 29.22. The breaking of single bonds, \nsuch as C    C, C   O or C   N, is the most common cause \nof fragmentation.\nquestion\n9\t \u0007Look at Figure 29.25 on page 447, which shows the \nmass spectrum of ethanol, C2H5OH.

For \nexample, a molecular ion peak at 45 could be caused by \nC2H7N or CH3NO. However, a high-resolution mass \nspectrum would show the C2H7N+ peak at 45.057 846 and \nthe CH3NO+ peak at 45.021 462. We can, therefore, be sure \nwhich molecule is being analysed.\nUsing the [M + 1] peak\nThere will always be a very small peak just beyond the \nmolecular ion peak at a mass of [M + 1]. This is caused \nby molecules in which one of the carbon atoms is the 13C \nisotope.
