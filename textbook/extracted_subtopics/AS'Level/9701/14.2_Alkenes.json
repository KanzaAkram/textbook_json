    "content": "homolytically. A methyl free radical, CH3, is produced. \nThis can then attack a chlorine molecule, forming \nchloromethane and regenerating a chlorine free radical:\nCH3  +  Cl2  \n  CH3Cl  +  Cl\nThen the first propagation step can be repeated as the \nchlorine free radical can attack another methane molecule. \nThis forms the methyl free radical, which regenerates \nanother chlorine free radical, and so on …\nThe word ‘propagation’ usually refers to growing \nnew plants. In this mechanism the substitution reaction \nprogresses (grows) in a kind of chain reaction.\nThis reaction is not really suitable for preparing \nspecific halogenoalkanes, because we get a mixture of \nsubstitution products. In the reaction between methane \nand chlorine, the products can include dichloromethane, \ntrichloromethane and tetrachloromethane as well \nas chloromethane. These other products result from \npropagation steps in which a chlorine free radical attacks a \nhalogenoalkane already formed. For example:\nCH3Cl  +  Cl   \n  CH2Cl  +  HCl\nThis can then be followed by:\nCH2Cl  +  Cl2  \n  CH2Cl2  +  Cl\ndichloromethane\nThe more chlorine gas in the reaction mixture to start \nwith, the greater the proportions of CH2Cl2, CHCl3 and \nCCl4 formed as products.\nTermination steps\nWhenever two free radicals meet they will react with  \neach other. A single molecule is the only product. \nAs no free radicals are made that can carry on the \nreaction sequence, the chain reaction stops. Examples of \ntermination steps include:\nCH3  +  Cl   \n  CH3Cl\nCH3  +   CH3  \n  C2H6\n■\n■\nIn the initiation step we start with a molecule and get two \nfree radicals formed.\n■\n■\nIn the propagation steps we start with a molecule plus a \nfree radical and get a different molecule and a different free \nradical formed.\n■\n■\nIn the termination steps we start with two free radicals and \nend up with a molecule and no free radicals.\n\nChapter 15: Hydrocarbons\nOverall, the reaction between alkanes and halogens, \ninvolving initiation, propagation and termination steps, is \ncalled free-radical substitution.\nQuestion\n6\t Bromine can react with ethane to form bromoethane.\na\t \u0007What conditions are needed for the reaction \nbetween ethane and bromine to take place?\nb\t \u0007What do we call this type of reaction?\nc\t\n\u0007Write an equation to show the reaction of ethane \nand bromine to form bromoethane.\nd\t \u0007Why is this reaction not a good way to prepare a \npure sample of bromoethane?\ne\t i\t\n\u0007Name the three steps in the mechanism of  \nthis reaction.\nii\t \u0007Write an equation to show the first step in  \nthe mechanism.\niii\t \u0007What type of bond breaking does this first  \nstep involve?\nThe alkenes\n207\nWe have looked at the nature of the double bond found in \nthe hydrocarbons called alkenes on pages 193–4. Alkenes \nwith one double bond per molecule have the general \nformula CnH2n. One example is ethene, C2H4. Alkanes are \ndescribed as saturated hydrocarbons; however, alkenes are \ndescribed as unsaturated hydrocarbons.\nOil refineries provide useful alkenes for the chemical \nindustry. On page 203 we saw how crude oil is separated \ninto fractions at a refinery. Oil companies find that the \ndemand for the each fraction differs. The lighter fractions, \nsuch as the gasoline fraction, are in high demand. So, \nsome of the excess heavier fractions are converted to \nlighter hydrocarbons. The large, less useful hydrocarbon \nmolecules are broken down into smaller, more useful \nmolecules. The process is called cracking.\nThe larger hydrocarbon molecules are fed into a steel \nchamber that contains no oxygen, so combustion does \nnot take place. The larger hydrocarbon molecules are \nheated to a high temperature and are passed over a catalyst \n(Figure 15.11).\nWhen large alkane molecules are cracked they form \nsmaller alkane molecules and alkene molecules. One \npossible example of a cracking reaction is:\nCH3(CH2)8CH3\t\n CH3(CH2)4CH3 \t+ CH2   CHCH2CH3\n\t\nC10H22 \t\n\t\nC6H14 \t\n+ \t\nC4H8\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\na\nb\n208\nFigure 15.11  a A catalytic cracker occupies the bulk of the  \ncentral part of this view of an oil refinery. b A computer graphic \nshowing a zeolite catalyst used to crack hydrocarbons.\nThe low-molecular mass alkanes formed (C6H14 in this \nexample) make very useful fuels and are in high demand. \nHowever, the alkenes produced (C4H8 in this example) are \nalso very useful. They are more reactive than the alkanes \nbecause of their double bonds. This makes them useful \nfor the chemical industry as the starting compounds \n(feedstock) for making many new products. These include \nmost plastics (see page YYY).\nQuestion\n7\t a\t \u0007Name the first member of the homologous series \nof alkenes.\nb\t \u0007What is the molecular formula of the alkene \ncontaining 18 carbon atoms and one C   C bond?\nc\t\n\u0007Look at the equation for cracking given in the text. \nWrite a word equation for this reaction.\nd\t \u0007Write a balanced equation to show the cracking of \nnonane into heptane and ethene.\n\nAddition reactions of the \nalkenes\nMost reactions of the alkenes are examples of addition \nreactions. In these reactions one of the two bonds in the \ncarbon–carbon double bond is broken and a new single \nbond is formed from each of the two carbon atoms. The \ngeneral addition reactions are shown in Figure 15.12.\nX\nY\nC\n+\nC\nC\nY\nX\na\nC\nZ\nZ\nb\nC\n+\nC\nC\nZ\nZ\nC\nFigure 15.12  General equations for addition reactions of the \nalkenes: a with a hydrogen halide such as hydrogen bromide, \nand b with a halogen such as chlorine.

These \nbecome partially saturated by reacting them with hydrogen. \nThis raises the melting points of the oils, changing them from \nliquids to soft solids that can be spread easily.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nAddition of steam, H2O(g)\nThe addition of steam to alkenes is used in industry to \nmake alcohols. Steam and the gaseous alkene, in the \npresence of concentrated phosphoric acid as the catalyst, \nare reacted at a temperature of 330 °C and a pressure of \n6 MPa. When the alkene is ethene, the product is ethanol \n(Figure 15.14). However, the ethanol found in alcoholic \ndrinks is always produced by the fermentation of glucose.\nH\nOH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH3PO4\nH2O\n+\nC\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nconc.\nphosphoric\nacid\nethene\n+\nsteam\nethanol\nFigure 15.14  The reaction between ethene and steam.\nAddition of hydrogen halides, HX(aq)\nWhen an alkene is bubbled through a concentrated \nsolution of a hydrogen halide (HF, HCl, HBr, HI) at room \ntemperature, the product is a halogenoalkane. For example:\nCH2    CH2  +  HBr  \n  CH3CH2Br\nethene\t\n bromoethane\nWith longer, asymmetric alkenes there are always two \npossible products that could be formed. For example, with \npropene:\nCH3CH    CH2  +  HBr  \n  CH3CH2CH2Br\n\t\npropene\t\n 1-bromopropane\nand\nCH3CH    CH2  +  HBr  \n  CH3CHBrCH3\n\t\npropene\t\n 2-bromopropane\nWhere two products are formed, the major product is \nthe one that has the halogen atom bonded to the carbon \nwith the least number of hydrogen atoms (in this case \nCH3CHBrCH3). This is because the CH3CHBrCH3 is formed \nfrom a secondary carbocation intermediate. On page \n197 we saw that this ion is more stable than the primary \ncarbocation so is more readily formed in the course of \na reaction. The mechanism that follows shows how a \ncarbocation forms and is then attacked by a negative ion \nto give the product of the addition reaction.\n\nChapter 15: Hydrocarbons\nAddition of halogens, X2(aq)\nIf we bubble an alkene through a solution of chlorine or \nbromine at room temperature, we again get an addition \nreaction. The colour of the halogen molecules in solution, \nwhich is pale green for chlorine water and orange/yellow \nfor bromine water, is removed. In fact, bromine water \nis used to test for the presence of the C   C bond in \ncompounds. The compound to be tested is shaken with \nbromine water. If it is unsaturated, the bromine water will \nbe decolorised (Figure 15.15).\nH\nH\nH\nH\n+\nH\nC\nC\nH\nBr2\n⎯\n⎯→\nC\nC\nH\nH\nBr\nBr\n⎯\n⎯→\nethene\nbromine\n1,2-dibromoethane\n+\nFigure 15.15  The reaction between ethene and bromine.\n209\nThe mechanism of electrophilic addition \nto alkenes\nOn pages 193–4 we saw how the double bond in ethene \nis formed from a σ bond and a π bond. There are four \nelectrons in total in these two bonds. So although ethene \nis a non-polar molecule, there is an area of high electron \ndensity around the C   C bond. This makes the alkenes \nopen to attack by electrophiles (see page 197).\nRemember that an electrophile is an acceptor of a \npair of electrons. HBr is a polar molecule because of the \ndifference in electronegativity between the H atom and the \nBr atom. In a molecule of HBr, the H atom carries a partial \npositive charge and the Br atom carries a partial negative \ncharge. In the mechanism of addition, the H atom acts as \nthe electrophile, accepting a pair of electrons from the  \nC   C bond in the alkene.\nBut how can a non-polar molecule such as Br2 act as \nan electrophile? As the bromine molecule and ethene \nmolecules approach each other, the area of high electron \ndensity around the C   C bond repels the pair of electrons \nin the Br \n Br bond away from the nearer Br atom. \nThis makes the nearer Br atom slightly positive and the \nfurther Br atom slightly negative. Figure 15.16 shows the \nmechanism of electrophilic addition.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\ncarbocation\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\n⎯→\n⎯→\nH\nH\nC\nH\nH\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\n+\nH\nH\nBr\nBr\n–\nBr\nBr\nBrδ+\nBrδ–\nFigure 15.16  The mechanism of electrophilic addition of \nbromine to ethene.\nAs the new bond between the C and Br atom forms, the  \nBr \n Br bond breaks heterolytically (see page 196). The Br− \nion formed then attacks the highly reactive carbocation \nintermediate. So one bromine atom bonds to each carbon \natom, producing 1,2-dibromoethane.\nquestions\n8\t a\t \u0007State the conditions used in the reaction between \nan alkene and hydrogen.\nb\t \u0007Name the product formed when propene reacts \nwith chlorine.\nc\t\n\u0007Ethanol can be used as a solvent.

The products formed will depend on the conditions \nchosen for the reaction. In Figure 15.17, the R, R1 and R2 \nare alkyl groups.\n\nCold dilute acidified manganate(VII) solution\nIf an alkene is shaken with a dilute solution of \nacidified potassium manganate(VII) at room \ntemperature, the pale purple solution turns \ncolourless. The alkene is converted into a diol, i.e. a \ncompound with two alcohol ( \n OH) groups:\nOH\nOH\nH\nH\nC\nO\n[O]\n+\n+\nC\nC\nH\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nethene\nethane-1,2-diol\nH\nH\nThis reaction can be used as a test to find out \nwhether a compound is unsaturated. However, \nthe decolorisation of bromine water is a more \ncommonly used test (see page 209).\nHot, concentrated manganate(VII) \nsolution\nUnder these harsher conditions, the C   C bond in the \nalkene is broken completely. The O \n H groups in the \ndiol formed initially are further oxidised to ketones, \naldehydes, carboxylic acids or carbon dioxide gas. The \nactual products depend on what is bonded to the carbon \natoms involved in the C   C bond.

To do this we would need \nto identify the products of the oxidation reaction and work \nbackwards to deduce the original alkene. If, for example, \ncarbon dioxide is given off in the oxidation, this tells us \nthat the double bond was between the end two carbon \natoms in the alkene.\nWe can summarise the oxidations under harsh \nconditions (using a hot, concentrated solution of \npotassium managanate(VII)) in three reactions.\n1\t H2C    CH2  \n  CO2  +  CO2\n\t\nIf a carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms we \nget oxidation to a CO2 molecule.\n2\t RHC    CHR  \n  RCHO  +  RCHO \n\t\n  RCOOH  +  RCOOH\nIf a carbon atom is bonded to one hydrogen atom \nand one alkyl group we get oxidation to a    COOH \n(carboxylic acid) group.\n3\t R1R2C    CR3R4  \n  R1R2C   O  +  R3R4C   O\nIf a carbon atom is bonded to two alkyl groups we get \noxidation to a C   O (ketone) group.\nquestions\n10\t a\t \u0007Name and draw the displayed formula of the organic \nproduct formed when propene is oxidised by a cold \nsolution of acidified potassium manganate(VII).\nb\t \u0007Name and draw the displayed formula of the organic \nproduct formed when but-2-ene is oxidised by a cold \nsolution of acidified potassium manganate(VII).\n11\t a\t i\t\n\u0007What effect does a hot, concentrated solution of \nacidified potassium manganate(VII) have on an \nalkene?\nii\t \u0007Why is this reaction useful to chemists?\nb\t \u0007An alkene is known to be either but-1-ene or but-2-ene. \nWhen heated with concentrated acidified potassium \nmanganate(VII) solution, bubbles of carbon dioxide gas \nwere given off. Name the alkene.\n\nChapter 15: Hydrocarbons\nAddition polymerisation\nProbably the most important addition reaction of the \nalkenes forms the basis of much of the plastics industry. \nMolecules of ethene, as well as other unsaturated \ncompounds, can react with each other under the right \nconditions to form polymer molecules. A polymer is a long-\nchain molecule made up of many repeating units. The small, \nreactive molecules that react together to make the polymer \nare called monomers. Up to 10 000 ethene monomers can \nbond together to form the polymer chains of poly(ethene). \nPoly(ethene) is commonly used to make carrier bags. \nOther alkenes also polymerise to make polymers with \ndifferent properties. Examples of other poly(alkenes) include \npoly(propene) and poly(phenylethene).\nWe can show the polymerisation reaction of ethene as:\nnC2H4 \n  [–C2H4 ]–n \n\t ethene\t\npoly(ethene)\nor by using the displayed formulae:\nH\nH\nH\nH\nn\nC\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nn\nn is very large, e.g. up to 10 000\n211\nThe section of the polymer shown in the brackets is the \nrepeat unit of the polymer.\nThe reaction is called addition polymerisation. As in \nother addition reactions, it involves the breaking of the π \nbond in each C   C bond, then the monomers link together.\nc\t\n\u0007Pent-2-ene is heated with concentrated acidified \npotassium manganate(VII) solution.\ni\t\n\u0007Draw the displayed formulae of the products and \nname them.\nii\t \u0007Write a balanced chemical equation for  \nthis reaction, using [O] to show oxygen  \natoms involved.\nd\t \u00072-Methylbut-2-ene is heated with concentrated \nacidified potassium manganate(VII) solution.\ni\t\n\u0007Draw the displayed formulae of the products and \nname them.\nii\t \u0007Write a balanced chemical equation for  \nthis reaction, using [O] to show oxygen  \natoms involved.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nWe can also use substituted alkenes, such as \nchloroethene, as monomers:\nnH2C—CHCl  \n  [–H2C—CHCl  ]–n \n\t\nchloroethene\t\npoly(chloroethene)\nThe  [–H2C—CHCl  ]– section of the polymer chain is \nthe repeat unit of poly(chloroethene) (Figure 15.18). In \npoly(alkenes) made of one type of monomer, the repeat \nunit is the same as the monomer except that the C   C \ndouble bond is changed to a C \n C single bond. Notice \nthat, as in any other addition reaction of the alkenes, \naddition polymerisation yields only one product.\nFigure 15.18  A 3D displayed formula of a small section of the \npoly(chloroethene) molecule. Its common name is PVC, as the \nold name for chloroethene was vinyl chloride.\nRemember that:\n212\n■\n■\nthe section of the polymer chain shown inside the \nbrackets in its structural or displayed formula is called \nits repeat unit\n■\n■\naddition polymerisation is characterised by:\n–\t monomers which are unsaturated, e.g. contain a  \nC   C double bond\n–\t the polymer being the only product of the reaction.\nDisposal of poly(alkene) plastics\nPlastics are widely used in many aspects of everyday life. \nHowever, the large-scale use of poly(alkene)s has created a \nproblem when we come to dispose of them. During their \nuseful life, one of the poly(alkene)s’ useful properties is \ntheir lack of reactivity. As they are effectively huge alkane \nmolecules, they are resistant to chemical attack. So they \ncan take hundreds of years to decompose when dumped \nin landfill sites, taking up valuable space. They are non-\nbiodegradable. Therefore throwing away poly(alkenes)\ncreates rubbish that will pollute the environment for \ncenturies (Figure 15.19).\nBurning plastic waste\nOne way to solve this problem would be to burn the \npoly(alkene)s and use the energy released to generate \nelectricity. As we have seen on page 204, if hydrocarbons \nburn in excess oxygen the products are carbon dioxide\n\nFigure 15.19  A beach littered with poly(alkene) plastic waste.\nand water. So this solution would not help combat global \nwarming, but would help to conserve our supplies of \nfossil fuels that currently generate most of our electricity. \nHowever, we have also seen that toxic carbon monoxide \nis produced from incomplete combustion  \nof hydrocarbons.\nAnother problem is the difficulty recycling plants have \nin separating other plastic waste from the poly(alkene)\ns when objects have just been thrown away without \nbeing sorted according to their recycling code. Then if \npoly(chloroethene) is burnt, acidic hydrogen chloride \ngas will be given off, as well as toxic compounds called \ndioxins. Acidic gases would have to be neutralised before \nreleasing the waste gas into the atmosphere and very high \ntemperatures used in incinerators to break down any toxins.\nquestions\n12\t Tetrafluoroethene, C2F4, is the monomer for the \npolymer PTFE, which is used in the non-stick coating \non pans.\na\t \u0007What does PTFE stand for?\nb\t \u0007What do we call the type of reaction used to  \nform PTFE?\nc\t\n\u0007Write a chemical equation to show the formation \nof PTFE from C2F4.\nd\t \u0007Draw the structure of the repeat unit in PTFE.\n13\t a\t \u0007How could poly(alkene) waste be used to conserve \nfossil fuels?\nb\t \u0007Why would your answer to part a add to the \nproblem of enhanced global warming?\nc\t\n\u0007A waste batch of poly(ethene) pellets was burnt in \nan inefficient industrial incinerator.
