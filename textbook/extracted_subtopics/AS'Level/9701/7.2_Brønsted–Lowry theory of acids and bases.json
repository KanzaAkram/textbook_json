A salt and water are formed.\n2HCl(aq)  +  CaO(s)  \n  CaCl2(aq)  +  H2O(l)\n\t\nacid\t\nbase\nThe equation above also shows us a very simple definition \nof a base. A base is a substance that neutralises an acid.\nIf we look at the formulae for a number of acids in \nTable 8.6, we see that they all contain hydrogen atoms. \nWhen the acid dissolves in water, it ionises and forms \nhydrogen ions. Note that in organic acids such as \ncarboxylic acids (see page 231) only some of the hydrogen \natoms are capable of forming ions.\n\na\nb\nFigure 8.11  a  The sour taste of lemons is due to citric acid \nand that of vinegar is due to ethanoic acid. b  Washing soda \nis a base used to soften water prior to washing clothes.

For example:\nHCl(g)  +  aq  \n  H+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\nThe formulae for a number of bases are given in  \nTable 8.7. Many metal oxides or hydroxides are bases. \nSome bases dissolve in water to form hydroxide ions  \nin solution. A base that is soluble in water is called an \nalkali. For example:\nNaOH(g)  +  aq  \n  Na+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nSome alkalis are formed by the reaction of a base with \nwater. When ammonia gas dissolves in water, some of \nthe ammonia molecules react with water molecules. \nHydroxide ions are released in this reaction.\nNH3(g)  +  H2O(l)  \n  NH4\n+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nAqueous ammonia is therefore an alkali. We can also see \nfrom the equation above that the ammonia has accepted a \nhydrogen ion to become NH4\n+. So a wider definition of a \nbase is a substance that accepts hydrogen ions.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nName of base\nFormula\ncalcium oxide\nCaO\ncopper(II) oxide\nCuO\nsodium hydroxide\nNaOH\ncalcium hydroxide\nCa(OH)2\nammonia\nNH3\nTable 8.7  The formulae of some common bases.\nQuestion\n13\t a\t \u0007Write an equation to show potassium hydroxide \ndissolving in water.\nb\t \u0007Write an equation for liquid nitric acid dissolving  \nin water.\nc\t\nWrite ionic equations for:\ni\t\n\u0007the reaction in aqueous solution between \nsodium hydroxide and nitric acid\nii\t \u0007the reaction in aqueous solution between \npotassium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid.\nThe Brønsted–Lowry theory of acids  \nand bases\nThe definitions of acids and bases given above are limited \nto reactions taking place in water. In 1923 the Danish \nchemist J. Brønsted and the English chemist T. Lowry \nsuggested a more general definition of acids and bases. \nThis definition is based on the idea that in an acid–base \nreaction, a proton is transferred from an acid to a base (a \nproton is a hydrogen ion, H+).\nH2O(l)\nHCl(g)\nproton\nH\nH\nH\nH\nthe proton, H+, is donated\nby the hydrogen chloride\nand accepted by the water…\n\nChapter 8: Equilibrium\nA Brønsted–Lowry acid is a proton donor.\nA Brønsted–Lowry base is a proton acceptor.\nWhen hydrochloric acid is formed, hydrogen chloride gas \ndissolves in water and reacts to form hydroxonium ions, \nH3O+, and chloride ions (Figure 8.12). You can see that the \nwater is involved in the reaction.\nHCl(g)  +  H2O(l)  \n  H3O+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\nHydrochloric acid is an acid because it donates a proton \nto water. This means that water is acting as a Brønsted–\nLowry base. The water is accepting a proton.\nH+ donated\nHCl(g)  +  H2O(l)  \n  H3O+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\n\t acid\t\nbase\nWater can also act as an acid. When ammonia reacts with \nwater, it accepts a proton from the water and becomes an \nNH4\n+ ion (Figure 8.13).\nH+ donated\n131\nNH3(g)  +  H2O(l)  \n  NH4\n+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nbase\t\nacid\nSubstances like water, which can act as either acids or \nbases, are described as amphoteric.\n+\n+\nH3O+(aq)\nCl–(aq)\n+\n–\nH\nH\nO\nO\nCl\nCl\n…forming the\npositive hydroxonium ion…\n…and leaving a\nnegative chloride ion\nFigure 8.12  An acid is a proton donor. Hydrogen chloride is the acid in this reaction. A base is a proton acceptor. Water is the base \nin this reaction. Remember that a proton is a hydrogen ion, H+.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nH2O(l)\nH\nH\nO\nH\nN\nH\nH\nthe proton, H+, is donated\nby the water and accepted\nby the ammonia…\nFigure 8.13  Water is the proton donor (it is the acid); ammonia is the proton acceptor (it is the base).\nBrønsted–Lowry acids and bases do not have to involve \naqueous solutions. For example, when chloric(VII) acid \n(HClO4) reacts with ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) in an inert \nsolvent, the following equilibrium is set up:\nH+ donated\nHClO4  +  CH3COOH  \n  ClO4\n–  +  CH3COOH2\n+\nacid \t\nbase\n132\nIn this reaction HClO4 is the acid because it is donating a \nproton to CH3COOH. CH3COOH is the base because it is \na proton acceptor.\nWhen an acid or base reacts with water, an equilibrium \nmixture is formed. For acids such as hydrochloric acid, \nthe position of equilibrium is almost entirely in favour of \nthe products. But for ammonia the position of equilibrium \nfavours the reactants. The equations can be written to \nshow this. For example:\nHCl(g)  +  aq  \n  H+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\nA forward arrow is used as this reaction goes to \ncompletion.\nNH3(g)  +  H2O(l)  \n  NH4\n+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nAn equilibrium arrow is used as this reaction does not go \nto completion.\nQuestion\n14\t Identify which reactants are acids and which are bases \nin the following reactions:\na\t NH4\n+  +  H2O  \n  NH3  +  H3O+\nb\t HCOOH  +  HClO2  \n  HCOOH2\n+  +  ClO2\n–\n\nNH3(g)\n+\n+\nNH4+(aq)\nOH–(aq)\n+\nH\n–\nH\nH\nN\nO\nH\nH\n…forming\nthe positive\nammonium ion…\n…and the\nnegative\nhydroxide ion\nConjugate acids and conjugate bases\nIn a reaction at equilibrium, products are being converted \nto reactants at the same rate as reactants are being \nconverted to products. The reverse reaction can also be \nconsidered in terms of the Brønsted–Lowry theory of \nacids and bases.\nConsider the reaction:\nNH3(g)  +  H2O(l)  \n  NH4\n+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nIn the reverse reaction, the NH4\n+ ion donates a proton \nto the OH– ion. So NH4\n+ is acting as an acid and OH– is \nacting as a base.\nH+ donated\nNH3(g)  +  H2O(l)  \n  NH4\n+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nacid\t\nbase\nIf a reactant is linked to a product by the transfer of a \nproton we call this pair a conjugate pair. Consider the \nfollowing reaction:\nconjugate pair\nHCl(g)  +  H2O(l)  \n  H3O+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\nacid\t\nbase\t\nacid\t\nbase\nconjugate pair\nLooking at the forward reaction:\n■\n■\nCl– is the conjugate base of the acid HCl\n■\n■\nH3O+ is the conjugate acid of the base H2O.",
