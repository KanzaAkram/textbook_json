    "content": "Introduction\nIn order to explain how chemical substances behaved, \nscientists first had to understand what the substances \nthemselves were made from. Over time, a model was \ndeveloped in which all substances were composed \nof atoms of elements. Originally it was thought that \natoms could not themselves be broken up into yet \nsmaller parts, but now we understand the structure \ninside the atoms themselves, and the role of electrons, \nprotons and neutrons. We can now design and make \nmaterials and objects almost at the atomic level.\nNanotechnology is the design and making of objects \nthat may have a thickness of only a few thousand \natoms or less. Groups of atoms can be moved around \non special surfaces. In this way scientists hope to \ndevelop tiny machines that may help deliver medical \ndrugs to exactly where they are needed in the body.\nElements and atoms\nEvery substance in our world is made up from chemical \nelements. These chemical elements cannot be broken down \nfurther into simpler substances by chemical means. A few \nelements, such as nitrogen and gold, are found on their \nown in nature, not combined with other elements. Most \nelements, however, are found in combination with other \nelements as compounds.\nEvery element has its own chemical symbol. The \nsymbols are often derived from Latin or Greek words. \nSome examples are shown in Table 2.1.\nElement\nSymbol\ncarbon\nC\nlithium\nLi (from Greek ‘lithos’)\niron\nFe (from Latin ‘ferrum’)\npotassium\nK (from Arabic ‘al-qualyah’ or from the \nLatin ‘kalium’)\nTable 2.1  Some examples of chemical symbols.\nChemical elements contain only one type of atom. An \natom is the smallest part of an element that can take part \nin a chemical change. Atoms are very small. The diameter \nof a hydrogen atom is approximately 10–10 m, so the mass \nof an atom must also be very small. A single hydrogen \natom weighs only 1.67 × 10–27 kg.\n\nChapter 2: Atomic structure\nFigure 2.1  Each of the blue peaks in this image is an \nindividual molecule. The molecules can be moved over \na copper surface, making this a molecular abacus or  \ncounting device.\n25\nFigure 2.2  Our Sun is made largely of the elements hydrogen \nand helium. This is a composite image made using X-ray and \nsolar optical telescopes.\nInside the atom\nThe structure of an atom\nEvery atom has nearly all of its mass concentrated in a \ntiny region in the centre of the atom called the nucleus. \nThe nucleus is made up of particles called nucleons. There\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nare two types of nucleon: protons and neutrons. Atoms of \ndifferent elements have different numbers of protons.\nOutside the nucleus, particles called electrons move \naround in regions of space called orbitals (see page 37). \nChemists often find it convenient to use a model of the \natom in which electrons move around the nucleus in \nelectron shells. Each shell is a certain distance from the \nnucleus at its own particular energy level (see page 37). \nIn a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the \nnumber of protons. A simple model of a carbon atom is \nshown in Figure 2.3.\nelectron\nnucleus\nelectron shells\n(energy levels)\nneutron\nproton\n26\nFigure 2.3  A model of a carbon atom. This model is not very \naccurate but it is useful for understanding what happens to \nthe electrons during chemical reactions.\nExperiments with subatomic particles\nWe can deduce the electric charge of subatomic \nparticles by showing how beams of electrons, \nprotons and neutrons behave in electric fields. If we \nfire a beam of electrons past electrically charged \nplates, the electrons are deflected (bent) away from \nthe negative plate and towards the positive plate \n(Figure 2.5a). This shows us that the electrons are \nnegatively charged.\nA cathode-ray tube (Figure 2.5b) can be used to \nproduce beams of electrons. At one end of the tube\na\n–\nelectron\nbeam\n+\n\nAtoms are tiny, but the nucleus of an atom is far tinier \nstill. If the diameter of an atom were the size of a football \nstadium, the nucleus would only be the size of a pea. This \nmeans that most of the atom is empty space! Electrons are \neven smaller than protons and neutrons.\nFigure 2.4  Ernest Rutherford (left) and Hans Geiger (right) \nusing their alpha-particle apparatus.

The direction of the deflection shows us that the electron is \nnegatively charged.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nExperiments with subatomic particles (continued)\nis a metal wire (cathode), which is heated to a high \ntemperature when a low voltage is applied to it. At \nthe other end of the tube is a fluorescent screen, \nwhich glows when electrons hit it.\nThe electrons are given off from the heated wire and \nare attracted towards two metal plates, which are \npositively charged. As they pass through the metal \nplates the electrons form a beam. When the electron \nbeam hits the screen a spot of light is produced. \nWhen an electric field is applied across this beam \nthe electrons are deflected (bent). The fact that the \nelectrons are so easily attracted to the positively \ncharged anode and that they are easily deflected by \nan electric field shows us that:\n■\n■\nelectrons have a negative charge\n■\n■\nelectrons have a very small mass.\nFigure 2.6  J. J. Thomson calculated the charge to mass \nratio of electrons. He used results from experiments with \nelectrons in cathode-ray tubes.\nQuestion\n1\t \u0007A beam of electrons is passing close to a highly \nnegatively charged plate. When the electrons pass \nclose to the plate, they are deflected (bent) away from \nthe plate.\n\nChapter 2: Atomic structure\nIn recent years, experiments have been carried out \nwith beams of electrons, protons and neutrons. The \nresults of these experiments show that:\n■\t a proton beam is deflected away from a positively \ncharged plate; as like charges repel, the protons must \nhave a positive charge (Figure 2.7)\n■\t an electron beam is deflected towards a positively \ncharged plate; as unlike charges attract, the electrons \nmust have a negative charge\n■\t a beam of neutrons is not deflected; this is because \nthey are uncharged.\nprotons detected on\nwalls of apparatus\n–\n+\n+\nbeam of\nprotons\n27\n+\nFigure 2.7  A beam of protons is deflected away from a \npositively charged area. This shows us that protons have \na positive charge.\nIn these experiments, huge voltages have to be \nused to show the deflection of the proton beam. \nThis contrasts with the very low voltages needed \nto show the deflection of an electron beam. These \nexperiments show us that protons are much heavier \nthan electrons. If we used the same voltage to \ndeflect electrons and protons, the beam of electrons \nwould have a far greater deflection than the beam \nof protons. This is because a proton is about 2000 \ntimes as heavy as an electron.\n\u0007a\t \u0007What deflection would you expect, if any, when the \nexperiment is repeated with beams of i protons and  \nii neutrons? Explain your answers.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Which subatomic particle (electron, proton or neutron) \nwould deviate the most?

The values of these are too small  \nto be very useful when discussing general chemical \nproperties. For example, the charge on a single electron  \nis –1.602 × 10–19 coulombs. We therefore compare their \nmasses and charges by using their relative charges and \nmasses. These are shown in Table 2.2.\nSubatomic \nparticle\nSymbol\nRelative \nmass\nRelative \ncharge\nelectron\ne\n​  1 \n____ \n1836 ​\n–1\nneutron\nn\n1\n0\nproton\np\n1\n+1\nTable 2.2  Comparing electrons, neutrons and protons.\nNumbers of nucleons\nProton number and nucleon number\nThe number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is called \nthe proton number (Z). It is also known as the atomic \nnumber. Every atom of the same element has the same \nnumber of protons in its nucleus. It is the proton number \nthat makes an atom what it is. For example, an atom with \na proton number of 11 must be an atom of the element \nsodium. The Periodic Table of elements is arranged in order \nof the proton numbers of the individual elements  \n(see Appendix 1, page 473).\nThe nucleon number (A) is the number of protons plus \nneutrons in the nucleus of an atom. This is also known as \nthe mass number.\n28\nHow many neutrons?\nWe can use the nucleon number and proton number to find \nthe number of neutrons in an atom. As:\nnucleon number = number of protons + number of neutrons\nThen:\nnumber of neutrons\t = nucleon number – number of protons\n\t\n= A – Z\nFor example, an atom of aluminium has a nucleon number \nof 27 and a proton number of 13. So an aluminium atom \nhas 27 – 13 = 14 neutrons.\n\nQuestion\n2\t \u0007Use the information in the table to deduce the number \nof electrons and neutrons in a neutral atom of:\n\u0007a\t \u0007vanadium\n\u0007b\t \u0007strontium\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007phosphorus.\nAtom\nNucleon number\nProton number\nvanadium\n51\n23\nstrontium\n84\n38\nphosphorus\n31\n15\nIsotopes\nAll atoms of the same element have the same number of \nprotons. However, they may have different numbers of \nneutrons. Atoms of the same element that have differing \nnumbers of neutrons are called isotopes.\nIsotopes are atoms of the same element with different \nnucleon (mass) numbers.\nIsotopes of a particular element have the same chemical \nproperties because they have the same number of \nelectrons. They have slightly different physical properties, \nsuch as small differences in density.\nWe can write symbols for isotopes. We write the \nnucleon number at the top left of the chemical symbol and \nthe proton number at the bottom left.\nThe symbol for the isotope of boron with 5 protons and \n11 nucleons is written:\nnucleon number  \n   11\nproton number    \n    5 B\nHydrogen has three isotopes. The atomic structure and \nisotopic symbols for the three isotopes of hydrogen are \nshown in Figure 2.8.\nWhen writing generally about isotopes, chemists also \nname them by omitting the proton number and placing \nthe nucleon number after the name. For example, the \nisotopes of hydrogen can be called hydrogen-1, hydrogen-2 \nand hydrogen-3.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nprotium\ndeuterium\nneutron\nelectron\nproton\nprotons\n1\n1\nneutrons\nisotopic symbol\nFigure 2.8  The atomic structure and isotopic symbols for the three isotopes of hydrogen.\nIsotopes can be radioactive or non-radioactive. Specific \nradioisotopes (radioactive isotopes) can be used to check \nfor leaks in oil or gas pipelines and to check the thickness \nof paper. They are also used in medicine to treat some \ntypes of cancer and to check the activity of the thyroid \ngland in the throat.\nQuestion\n3\t \u0007Use the Periodic Table on page 473 to help you.\n\u0007Write isotopic symbols for the following neutral atoms:\na\t \u0007bromine-81\n\u0007b\t \u0007calcium-44\n\u0007c\t \u0007iron-58\n\u0007d\t \u0007palladium-110.\nHow many protons, neutrons \nand electrons?\nIn a neutral atom the number of positively charged protons \nin the nucleus equals the number of negatively charged \nelectrons outside the nucleus. When an atom gains or loses \nelectrons, ions are formed, which are electrically charged. \nFor example:\nCl\t\n + \t\ne–\t\n \n \t\nCl–\nchlorine atom\t\n\t 1 electron gained\t\n\t\nchloride ion\n\t 17 protons\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n17 protons\n\t17 electrons\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n18 electrons\nThe chloride ion has a single negative charge because there \nare 17 protons (+) and 18 electrons (–).\n\nChapter 2: Atomic structure\ntritium\n1\n1\n2\n0\n1\n1H\n2\n1H\n3\n1H\nMg\t\n \t\nMg2+\t\n + \t\n2e–\nmagnesium \t\n\t\nmagnesium\t\n\t\n2 electrons\n\t\natom\t\n\t\nion\t\n\t\nremoved\n\t 12 protons\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n12 protons\n\t12 electrons\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n10 electrons\nThe magnesium ion has a charge of 2+ because it has 12 \nprotons (+) but only 10 electrons (–).\nThe isotopic symbol for an ion derived from sulfur-33 \nis ​33   \n16​S2–.
