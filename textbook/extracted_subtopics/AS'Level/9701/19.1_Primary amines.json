An ionic \nequation for this reaction is:\nCH3CH2Br  +  CN–  \n  CH3CH2CN  +  Br–\nbromoethane\t\npropanenitrile\nNote that in the reaction with the cyanide ion, an extra \ncarbon atom is added to the original halogenoalkane chain. \nIn this case, bromoethane is converted to propanenitrile.\nSometimes in industry chemists need to make a new \ncompound with one more carbon atom than the best \navailable organic raw material (the starting compound). \nTherefore, if we can convert the starting compound to a \nhalogenoalkane, we can then reflux with ethanolic KCN to \nmake a nitrile. We now have an intermediate nitrile with \nthe correct number of carbon atoms. \nWe will consider nitriles and their subsequent \nconversion to carboxylic acids and amines again in \nChapter 18, page 231.\n3  Substitution with ammonia, NH3  \n(in ethanol)\nIf a halogenoalkane is heated with an excess of ammonia \ndissolved in ethanol under pressure, an amine is formed.\n220\nCH3CH2Br  +  NH3  \n  CH3CH2NH2  +  HBr\n\t bromoethane\t\nethylamine\nHere the nucleophile is the ammonia molecule. \nEthylamine is a primary amine, as the nitrogen atom is \nattached to only one alkyl group. If the ammonia is not  \nin excess, we get a mixture of amine products. This \nis because the primary amine product will act as a \nnucleophile itself and will attack halogenoalkane \nmolecules, forming secondary amines, and so on. The \nsecondary amine formed above would be (CH3CH2)2NH, \ncalled diethylamine.

If we start with an excess of \n1-bromopropane, give the structural formula and \nname of the tertiary amine formed.\nMechanism of nucleophilic \nsubstitution in halogenoalkanes\nMany of the reactions of halogenoalkanes are nucleophilic \nsubstitutions. In these reactions, the nucleophile attacks \nthe carbon atom bonded to the halogen. Remember from \nChapter 14 that nucleophiles are donors of an electron pair \nand are attracted to electron-deficient atoms.\nThe carbon–halogen bond is polarised because the \nhalogen is more electronegative than carbon. Therefore \nthe carbon atom carries a partial positive charge as the \nelectron pair in the carbon–halogen bond is drawn  \nnearer to the halogen atom (shown in Figure 16.3). \nThe halogen atom is replaced by the nucleophile in the \nsubstitution reaction.\nH\nδ+\nC\nδ–\nX\nH\nH\nFigure 16.3  The carbon–halogen bond is polarised.\nThere are two possible mechanisms that can operate in the \nnucleophilic substitution reactions of halogenoalkanes. \nThe mechanism is determined by the structure of the \nhalogenoalkane involved in the reaction.\nMechanism for primary halogenoalkanes \n(SN2)\nIn primary halogenoalkanes containing one halogen \natom, the halogen atom is bonded to a carbon atom, \nwhich is itself bonded to one other carbon atom and \ntwo hydrogen atoms. This means that the carbon atom \nbonded to the halogen is attached to one alkyl group. For \nexample, 1-chloropropane, CH3CH2CH2Cl, is a primary \nhalogenoalkane. On page 220 we looked at the hydrolysis \nof bromoethane, another primary halogenoalkane. \nFigure 16.4 shows the mechanism for that reaction.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nH\nH\nδ+\nH\nC\nH\nHO–\nC\nH\nC\nH\nC\nδ–\nBr\nH\nFigure 16.4  The mechanism of nucleophilic substitution in a primary halogenoalkane.\nThe OH– ion donates a pair of electrons to the δ+ carbon \natom, forming a new covalent bond. At the same time, \nthe C   Br bond is breaking. The Br atom takes both the \nelectrons in the bond (an example of heterolytic fission of a \ncovalent bond, see page 196) and leaves as a Br– ion.\nThis mechanism is called an SN2 mechanism. The ‘S’ \nstands for substitution and the ‘N’ stands for nucleophilic. \nThe ‘2’ tells us that the rate of the reaction, which is \ndetermined by the slow step in the mechanism (see page \n141), involves two reacting species. Experiments show us \nthat the rate depends on both the concentration of the \nhalogenoalkane and the concentration of the hydroxide \nions present.\nMechanism for tertiary halogenoalkanes \n(SN1)\nIn a tertiary halogenoalkane, the carbon atom bonded \nto the halogen atom is also bonded to three other \ncarbon atoms (alkyl groups). For example, 2-bromo-2-\nmethylpropane is a tertiary halogenoalkane. Its structure \nis shown in Figure 16.5.\nH\nH\nC\nH\nH\nH\nC\nH\nC\nC\nH\nH\nBr\nH\nFigure 16.5  A tertiary halogenoalkane,  \n2-bromo-2-methylpropane.\nA tertiary halogenoalkane reacts with a hydroxide ion by \na two-step mechanism.

The \n‘1’ tells us that the rate of the reaction only depends \non one reagent, in this case the concentration of the \nhalogenoalkane, as shown in the first (slow) step of the \nmechanism. \nOnce again, this breaking of the C   Br bond is an \nexample of heterolytic fission.\nThe Br– ion forms again, as in the SN2 mechanism,  \nbut in this mechanism a carbocation ion forms. This \ndoes not happen with primary halogenoalkanes. This \nis because tertiary carbocations are more stable than \nprimary carbocations due to the inductive effect of the \nalkyl groups attached to the carbon atom bonded to  \nthe halogen. Alkyl groups tend to release electrons \nto atoms attached to them. So a tertiary carbocation \nhas three alkyl groups donating electrons towards the \npositively charged carbon atom, reducing its charge \ndensity. This makes it more stable than a primary \ncarbocation, which just has one alkyl group releasing \nelectrons (Figure 16.7).\nThe SN1 mechanism and the SN2 mechanism are both \nlikely to play a part in the nucleophilic substitution of \nsecondary halogenoalkanes.\n221\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nC\nH\nC\nC\nH\nC\nH\nC\nC+\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nprimary carbocation\n(least stable)\nFigure 16.7  The trend in the stability of primary, secondary and tertiary carbocations.\nquestions\n3\t \u0007Show the mechanism, including appropriate curly \narrows, for the hydrolysis of 1-chloropropane, \nCH3CH2CH2Cl, by alkali.\n4\t \u0007a\t \u0007Draw the structure (displayed formula) of  \n2-chloro-2-methylbutane.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Show the mechanism for the hydrolysis of \n2-chloro-2-methylbutane by alkali.\nElimination reactions\n222\nHalogenoalkanes also undergo elimination reactions. An \nelimination reaction involves the loss of a small molecule \nfrom the original organic molecule. In the case of \nhalogenoalkanes, this small molecule is a hydrogen halide, \nsuch as HCl or HBr.\nThe reagent used in these elimination reactions is \nethanolic sodium hydroxide:\nCH3CHBrCH3  +  NaOH(ethanol) \n\t 2-bromopropane\nCH2\n  CHCH3  +  H2O  +  NaBr\n\t\npropene\nThe original 2-bromopropane molecule has lost an H atom \nand a Br atom. We can think of it as HBr being eliminated \nfrom the halogenoalkane. The ethanolic OH– ion acts as \na base, accepting an H+ from the halogenoalkane to form \nwater. The C   Br bond breaks heterolytically, forming a \nBr– ion and leaving an alkene as the organic product.\nNotice the importance of the conditions used in \norganic reactions. If we use NaOH(aq), a nucleophilic \nsubstitution reaction occurs and an alcohol is produced. \nIf we use NaOH(ethanol), an elimination reaction occurs \nand an alkene is produced.\n\nH\nH\nH\nC\n+\nC\n+\nC\nH\nH\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nsecondary carbocation\ntertiary carbocation\n(most stable)\nQuestion\n5\t \u0007Write a balanced equation for the reaction of \nbromoethane with ethanolic sodium hydroxide.\nUses of halogenoalkanes\nHalogenoalkanes are rarely found naturally but they are \nimportant in the chemical industry. They are frequently \nmade as intermediates for making other useful substances \nbut have also found some uses themselves. We have \nalready seen at the start of this chapter how some \nhalogenoalkanes are important anaesthetics, for example \n2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (halothane). One \nof the essential properties of an anaesthetic is chemical \ninertness, and each halothane molecule contains three \nvery strong C   F bonds that are difficult to break, \nmaking halothane inert and safe to use in the aqueous \nenvironment inside the body.\nThe non-stick lining of pans is a ‘fluoropolymer’. Its \nname is poly(tetrafluoroethene) – often referred to by its \ntrade name Teflon®. The strength of the C   F bond means \nthat it can be used at high temperatures during cooking \nwithout breaking down. The polymer is now finding uses \nin ice-skating blades because of its durability and its ‘low-\nfriction’ properties.\nCFC substitutes containing fluorine\nCFCs are chlorofluorocarbons. Chemists refer to them \nas chlorofluoroalkanes. These organic compounds are all \nchemically inert (very unreactive). They are not flammable \nand are not toxic. These properties made volatile \nCFCs useful as aerosol propellants, solvents and as the \nrefrigerants inside fridges. They were also used as blowing \nagents for polymers such as expanded polystyrene.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nDichlorodifluoromethane is an example of a CFC used for \nthese purposes.\nWhen the compounds were discovered in the 1930s, \npeople could see no drawbacks to using the new ‘wonder \ncompounds’. However, CFCs have caused a serious \nenvironmental issue – the depletion of the ozone layer in \nthe upper atmosphere. The ozone layer protects the Earth by \nabsorbing harmful UV radiation arriving from the Sun.\nIt turns out that CFCs are unreactive in normal \nconditions, but high up in the atmosphere they become \ntotally different. The CFCs can persist in the atmosphere \nfor about a hundred years. They diffuse up to the \nstratosphere – and that’s where the problem starts. The \nUV light from the Sun breaks the C   Cl bonds in the \nCFC molecules. This releases highly reactive chlorine \natoms, called chlorine free radicals. These chlorine free \nradicals react with ozone molecules. In a sequence of \nchain reactions, it has been estimated that each chlorine \nfree radical can destroy a million ozone molecules \n(Figure 16.8).\nGovernments have tackled the problem, and most \nindustrialised countries have now banned the use of CFCs. \nChemists developed new compounds for fridges and \naerosols, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs): for example, \nCH2FCF3. These non-chlorinated compounds break down \nmore quickly once released into the air because of the \npresence of hydrogen in their molecules, so they never rise \nin the atmosphere as far as the ozone layer. There are now \nsigns that the ozone layer is recovering from the effects of \nCFCs. The hole in the ozone layer is very slowly closing up.\nSummary\n■\t If one or more of the hydrogen atoms in an alkane \nmolecule are replaced by halogen atoms, the \ncompound is called a halogenoalkane.\n■\t Iodoalkanes are the most reactive halogenoalkanes, \nwhereas fluoroalkanes are the least reactive. This \nis explained by the trend in the bond strength of \nthe carbon–halogen bonds. The C   F bond is the \nstrongest bond, and the C   I bond is the weakest \nbond. So the C   I bond is most easily broken during \nits reactions.\n■\t Halogenoalkanes are attacked by nucleophiles. This \nhappens because the carbon bonded to the halogen \ncarries a partial positive charge due to the higher \nelectronegativity of the halogen. Halogenoalkanes \nundergo nucleophilic substitution.\n\nChapter 16: Halogenoalkanes\nFigure 16.8  Banning the use of CFCs has meant that the hole \nin the ozone layer over Antarctica is now getting smaller.\nHFEs are hydrofluoroethers, which are solvents \nmarketed as ‘low global warming’ and are used in industry \nfor cleaning and drying. When fluorine replaces chlorine \nin a solvent the new compound is more stable, again due to \nC   F being stronger than C   Cl.\n223\nQuestion\n6\t \u0007How can such unreactive compounds as CFCs cause \nso much damage to the ozone layer?\n■\t Suitable nucleophiles include aqueous alkali,  \nOH– (aq), cyanide, CN–, and ammonia, NH3.\n■\t The reaction with OH– ions (or with water) is known \nas hydrolysis, and an alcohol is formed.\n■\t Halogenoalkanes will also undergo elimination \nreactions when heated with ethanolic sodium \nhydroxide, forming alkenes.\n■\t The fluoroalkanes and fluorohalogenoalkanes \nhave many uses, including anaesthetics, solvents, \nrefrigerants and aerosol propellants.\n■\t Chlorofluoroalkanes have been responsible for \ndamaging the Earth’s ozone layer, but alternative \ninert compounds, such as fluoroalkanes, are now \nreplacing the use of CFCs.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nEnd-of-chapter questions\n1  1-bromobutane will undergo reactions when heated, as shown by reactions A and B.\nCH3CH2CH2CH2Br\nA\nB\nCH3CH2CH2CH2OH\nCH3CH2CH=CH2\n \n a  For reactions A and B give the reagents used in each case. \n[2]\n \n b  Reaction A was repeated using 1-iodobutane instead of 1-bromobutane.

The sugar extracted \nfrom crops such as sugar cane and sugar beet can be \nfermented with yeast to make ethanol. Ethanol is  \na ‘biofuel’ and burns with a clean flame. This  \nprocess is becoming increasingly important as our \nsupplies of crude oil diminish and cleaner, easier to \nproduce biofuels are needed to take the place of petrol \nand diesel.\nThe homologous series of \nalcohols\nAlcohols are organic molecules containing the hydroxyl \ngroup, \n OH. With one hydroxyl group substituted into  \nan alkane molecule, the general formula is CnH2n + 1OH. \nThe alcohols are named by adding ‘-anol’ to the alkane \nstem. For example, CH3OH is called methanol. For alcohol \nmolecules with three or more carbon atoms, the position \nof the hydroxyl group is shown by inserting a number to \nindicate which carbon atom is bonded to the OH group. \nFigure 17.2 gives some examples.\n226\nCH3\nCH3\nCH2\nOH\nH3C\nCH\nOH\nH3C\nCH2\nH3C\nC\nOH\nCH3\npropan-1-ol\nprimary alcohol\npropan-2-ol\nsecondary alcohol\n2-methylpropan-2-ol\ntertiary alcohol\nFigure 17.2  Note that the numbering to show the position of \nthe OH group in an alcohol starts from the end of the molecule \nthat gives the smaller number.\nPropan-1-ol is classified as a primary alcohol. The carbon \natom bonded to the \n OH group is attached to one other \ncarbon atom (alkyl group). Propan-2-ol is a secondary \nalcohol as the carbon atom bonded to the \n OH group is \nattached to two other carbon atoms (alkyl groups). With \nthree alkyl groups attached, 2-methylpropan-2-ol is an \nexample of a tertiary alcohol.\nThe alcohols have higher boiling points than expected \nwhen compared with other organic molecules with similar\n\nFigure 17.1  The sugar extracted from sugar cane can be \nfermented with yeast to make ethanol.\nrelative molecular masses. Even methanol, the alcohol with \nthe lowest molar mass, is a liquid at room temperature. \nThis occurs because of hydrogen bonding between alcohol \nmolecules (see page 64). Hydrogen bonding also explains \nwhy the smaller alcohol molecules mix and dissolve so \nwell in water.\nQuestion\n1\t \u0007a\t \u0007Explain how hydrogen bonds arise:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007between ethanol molecules\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007between ethanol and water molecules.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Ethanol mixes with water in all proportions but \nhexan-1-ol is less miscible with water. Why is this?\nReactions of the alcohols\n1  Combustion\nWhen ignited, the alcohols react with oxygen in the air. \nThe products of complete combustion are carbon dioxide \nand water. For example, ethanol burns with a clean blue \nflame in a good supply of air:\nalcohol\t +\t oxygen\t\n\t carbon dioxide\t +\t water\nC2H5OH  \t+\t\n3O2\t\n\t\n2CO2\t\n+\t 3H2O\n\t\nethanol\nEthanol is sometimes used in Brazil as a car fuel. This \nreduces the use of petrol.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nA country like Brazil has few oil reserves but can grow plenty \nof sugar cane, which can be fermented to make ethanol, \nwhich is used as a fuel either in pure form or in mixtures with \nother fuels (Figure 17.3). As well as conserving the world’s \ndiminishing supplies of crude oil, sugar cane has the advantage \nof absorbing CO2 as it grows. Although the CO2 is effectively \nreturned to the atmosphere during fermentation and when the \nethanol burns, biofuels such as ethanol are said to be ‘carbon \nneutral’. Overall, they do not increase the greenhouse gases \nin the air (in theory). Even if we take into account the CO2 \nproduced in growing, harvesting, transporting and processing \nthe sugar cane, it is still much better for the environment to use \n‘bio-ethanol’ as a fuel than petrol or diesel from crude oil.\nFigure 17.3  The fuel called ‘gasohol’ is a mixture of ethanol \nand petrol.\nEthanol is used as a solvent as well as a fuel. We often use it \nas ‘methylated spirits’, which contains about 90% ethanol.\nQuestion\n2\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write a balanced equation for the complete \ncombustion of:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007propan-1-ol\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007butan-1-ol.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Glucose can be fermented with yeast in anaerobic \nconditions. Name the products of the reaction.\n2  Substitution to form a halogenoalkane\nIn this substitution reaction with a hydrogen halide, such \nas hydrogen chloride, the \n OH group in the alcohol is \nreplaced by a halogen atom to produce a halogenoalkane. \nThe carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group in the \nalcohol will carry a partial positive charge (as oxygen is \nmore electronegative than carbon). This makes the carbon\n\nChapter 17: Alcohols, esters and carboxylic acids\natom open to nucleophilic attack. The initial attack on the \nalcohol is by the partially negative halogen atom in the \nhydrogen halide:\nδ+\nH\nδ–\nX\nwhere X = halogen atom\nalcohol + hydrogen halide  \n  halogenoalkane + water\nFor example:\nCH3CH2OH + HCl  \n  CH3CH2Cl + 3H2O\n\t\nethanol\t\nchloroethane\nThe dry hydrogen chloride gas for this reaction can be \nmade in situ (in the reaction vessel). Sodium chloride and \nconcentrated sulfuric acid are used for this:\nNaCl  +  H2SO4  \n  NaHSO4  +  HCl\nHalogenation of an alcohol\nThe alcohol is heated under reflux (see apparatus \non page 219) with the reactants to make the \nhalogenoalkane. The halogenoalkane made can \nthen be distilled off from the reaction mixture and \ncollected as oily droplets under water (Figure 17.4).\n227\nFigure 17.4  Bromoethane being distilled off following \nthe reaction between ethanol and hydrogen bromide. \nThe white solid visible in the pear-shaped flask is sodium \nbromide (as crystals). The sodium bromide reacts with \nconcentrated sulfuric acid to make the hydrogen bromide \nneeded for the reaction.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nSulfur dichloride oxide, SOCl2, can also be used to \nsubstitute a chlorine atom into an alcohol molecule, as \nshown below:\nC2H5OH  +  SOCl2  \n  C2H5Cl  +  HCl  +  SO2\nNote that in this reaction the two byproducts of the \nreaction (HCl and SO2) are both gases. These escape from \nthe reaction mixture, leaving the halogenoalkane, without \nthe need to distil it off as in the hydrogen halide reaction.\nWe can also use phosphorus halides to provide the \nhalogen atoms for this substitution reaction.\nFor chloroalkanes we can use solid phosphorus(V) \nchloride, PCl5:\nroom temperature\nC2H5OH  +  PCl5  \n C2H5Cl  +  HCl  +  POCl3\nThe release of acidic hydrogen chloride gas from this \nreaction can be used as a test for the hydroxyl group. The \nHCl gas causes acidic ‘steamy fumes’ to be observed.\nPhosphorus(III) chloride can also be used to halogenate \nan alcohol, but this reaction does require heating.\nFor bromoalkanes and iodoalkanes we can make \nthe phosphorus(III) halide, PBr3 or PI3, in situ using red \nphosphorus and bromine or iodine. These are warmed \nwith the alcohol. For example:\n228\n3C2H5OH  +  PI3  \n  3C2H5I  +  H3PO3\n\t\niodoethane\nQuestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write a balanced equation to show the reaction \nbetween ethanol and hydrogen bromide.\n\u0007b\t \u0007What are the reagents and conditions used for  \nthis reaction?\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007What do we call this type of reaction?\n3  Reaction with sodium metal\nIn the reaction with hydrogen halides, the C   O bond in \nthe alcohol breaks. However, in some other reactions the  \nO   H bond in the alcohol breaks. The reaction with \nsodium metal is an example:\nC2H5OH  +  Na  \n  C2H5O–Na+  +  H2\n\t\nethanol\t\nsodium\t\nsodium ethoxide\t hydrogen\nThe reaction is similar to sodium’s reaction with water, but \nless vigorous. In both cases hydrogen gas is given off and\n\na basic ionic compound is formed. With ethanol, if the \nexcess ethanol is evaporated off after the reaction, a white \ncrystalline solid is left. This is the sodium ethoxide.\nOther alcohols react in a similar way with sodium. For \nexample, propan-1-ol would produce sodium propoxide \nplus hydrogen gas. \nIn general:\nalcohol  +  sodium  \n  sodium alkoxide  +  hydrogen\nWe find that the longer the hydrocarbon chain, the less \nvigorous the reaction.\nFigure 17.5  Sodium reacting with ethanol. The pink colour \nis from a colourless phenolphthalein indicator that has been \nadded to the ethanol, showing the basic nature of the sodium \nethoxide formed.\nQuestion\n4\t \u0007Lithium reacts with alcohols in a similar way to \nsodium. A small piece of lithium metal is dropped onto \na watch-glass containing propan-1-ol.\n\u0007a\t \u0007What would you observe?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Name the products of the reaction.\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007What difference would you expect to see if you \nused sodium instead of lithium in this reaction?\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n4  Esterification\nAlcohol plus carboxylic acid\nAnother reaction that involves the breaking of the \nO   H bond in alcohols is esterification, i.e. the \nmaking of esters. An esterification reaction is usually \nbetween an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. The \ngeneral equation is:\nacid catalyst\ncarboxylic acid  +  alcohol \n ester  +  water\nFor this reaction to take place, the carboxylic acid \nand alcohol are heated under reflux with a strong \nacid catalyst (usually concentrated sulfuric acid). \nThe reaction is reversible, so an equilibrium can \nbe established with all the reactants and products \nshown in the general equation present.\nThe esters formed usually have sweet, fruity smells. \nThey are present naturally in fruits, and we use  \nthem in artificial flavourings and perfumes \n(Figure 17.6). They are also used as solvents, e.g. in \nnail varnish remover.\nHere is an example of an esterification reaction:\nO\nH2SO 4\nO\nCH3C\nC2H5OH\nH2O\n+\n+\nCH3C\nOH\nOC2H5\nethanoic acid\nethyl ethanoate\nwater\nethanol\nThe ester formed is called ethyl ethanoate.\nWhat would be the name of the ester formed if \nethanol was reacted with propanoic acid? Would it be \npropyl ethanoate or ethyl propanoate? The answer\nHydrolysis of esters\nEsters can be hydrolysed by heating under reflux with \neither an acid or a base.\nRefluxing with an acid simply reverses the preparation \nof the ester from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. The \nacid catalyses the reaction. The reaction is reversible and \nan equilibrium mixture is established. In acid hydrolysis, \nthere are always both reactants (ester + water) and \nproducts (carboxylic acid + alcohol) present after the \nreaction.

That’s because the first part of \nan ester’s name comes from the alcohol: in this case \nethanol, giving ‘ethyl …’. The second part comes \nfrom the carboxylic acid, in this case propanoic acid, \ngiving ‘… propanoate’, thus making the name of the \nester formed ‘ethyl propanoate’:\nCH3CH2COOH  +  C2H5OH\n\t propanoic acid\t\nethanol\n\t\nH2SO4  CH3CH2COOC2H5  +  H2O\n\t\n\t ethyl propanoate\t\nwater\nO\nO\nH+(aq)\n+  H2O\nH3C\nH3C\nC\n+  CH3CH2OH\nC\nCH2CH3\nH\nO\nO\nHowever, when an ester is refluxed with an alkali (a \nsoluble base), such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, it is \nfully hydrolysed.

For many of their reactions, \nthe class of alcohol makes no difference to the type of \nproducts formed. In organic chemistry, we can usually \ngeneralise for the whole homologous series. However, when \nalcohols are oxidised, different products are obtained from \nprimary, secondary and tertiary alcohols.\nAlcohols can be oxidised by potassium dichromate(VI) \nsolution, K2Cr2O7, acidified with dilute sulfuric acid. The \nsolution’s orange colour is caused by the dichromate(VI) \nions, Cr2O7\n2–(aq). When the dichromate(VI) ions react as \nan oxidising agent, they themselves are reduced and turn \ninto chromium(III) ions, Cr3+(aq), which form a green \nsolution. The reaction mixture needs to be warmed before \nthe oxidation takes place.\nThe product formed when an alcohol is oxidised can \nbe used to distinguish between primary, secondary and \ntertiary alcohols. You can learn about the chemical tests \nfor the products on pages 238–9.\n■\n■\nWith tertiary alcohols, a mixture of the tertiary alcohol, \ndilute sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate(VI) solution \nremains orange when warmed. No reaction takes place \nunder these relatively mild conditions.\n■\n■\nA secondary alcohol, such as propan-2-ol, will be oxidised \nto form a ketone.

After warming, \nthe orange dichromate(VI) ions have been reduced to \ngreen chromium(III) ions by the primary and secondary \nalcohols. This shows that both the primary and \nsecondary alcohols have been oxidised but the tertiary \nalcohol, 2-methylpropan-2-ol, has not.\n\nChapter 17: Alcohols, esters and carboxylic acids\nQuestion\n7\t \u0007Propan-1-ol can be oxidised to propanal, CH3CH2CHO, \nand then to propanoic acid, CH3CH2COOH.\n\t\n\u0007a\t \u0007What reagents and conditions should be used to \noxidise propan-1-ol to propanal?\n\t\n\u0007b\t \u0007Write a balanced chemical equation for this \noxidation.

Dry ether is used because LiAlH4 reacts \nviolently with water.\nIn the simplified reduction equation, the symbol [H] \ncan be used to represent the hydrogen atoms from the \nreducing agent (remember that in organic chemistry, \nreduction can be thought of as the addition of hydrogen \natoms).

If an aldehyde or ketone is present, a \ndeep-orange precipitate is formed (Figure 18.3).\nFigure 18.3  The orange precipitate formed from  \n2,4-DNPH in a test with propanone, a ketone.\nThe structure of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is:\nNO2\nNH2\nO2N\nN\nH\nThe precipitate formed can be purified by \nrecrystallisation and its melting point can be \nmeasured experimentally. The identity of the \ncompound that precipitated out can then be found by \nreferring to melting point data. From this, the specific \naldehyde or ketone used in the test can be identified.\nThe reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with \n2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is an example of a \ncondensation reaction. In a condensation reaction, two \nmolecules join together and in the process eliminate a \nsmall molecule, in this case water. The equation for the \nreaction of ethanal with 2,4-DNPH is:\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCH3\nNO2\nNH2  +  O\nC\nO2N\nN\nH\natoms lost in condensation reaction \nto form water\nH\n2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine\nCH3\nNO2\nC\nN\nN\nN\nO2N\nH  +  H2O\nH\na 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone\nTesting with Tollens’ reagent\nTollens’ reagent is an aqueous solution of silver \nnitrate in excess ammonia solution, sometimes called \nammoniacal silver nitrate solution. The silver ions, \nAg+, in the solution act as a mild oxidising agent. When \nwarmed, the Ag+ ions will oxidise an aldehyde to form a \ncarboxylate ion.\nUnder alkaline conditions any carboxylic acid  \nformed is immediately neutralised to the carboxylate \nion,  COO–, as H+ is removed from  COOH and a  \nsalt is formed.\nIn the redox reaction with an aldehyde, the Ag+ ions \nthemselves are reduced to silver atoms. The silver \natoms form a ‘mirror’ on the inside of the tube, giving a \npositive test for an aldehyde (Figure 18.4).\nThere will be no change observed when a ketone is \nwarmed with Tollens’ reagent as no redox reaction takes \nplace. It remains a colourless mixture in the test tube.\nTesting with Fehling’s solution\nFehling’s solution is an alkaline solution containing \ncopper(II) ions. When warmed with an aldehyde, the Cu2+ \nions act as an oxidising agent. The aldehyde is oxidised to \na carboxylate ion while the Cu2+ ions are reduced to Cu+ \nions. The clear blue Fehling’s solution turns an opaque \nred/orange colour as a precipitate of copper(I) oxide forms \nthroughout the solution (Figure 18.5).\nOnce again, ketones are not oxidised, so the Fehling’s \nsolution remains blue when warmed.\n\nChapter 18: Carbonyl compounds\nOther classes of organic compound that also contain the \ncarbonyl group (such as carboxylic acids and esters) do not \nform precipitates.\nDistinguishing between aldehydes  \nand ketones\nAs we saw on page 236, aldehydes can be further oxidised \nto form carboxylic acids, but ketones cannot be oxidised \neasily. We can use this difference to distinguish between \nan aldehyde and a ketone in simple chemical tests. The two \ntests most commonly used involve Tollens’ reagent and \nFehling’s solution.\n239\nFigure 18.4  The ‘before’ and ‘after’ observations  \nwhen Tollens’ reagent is warmed with an aldehyde,  \nsuch as ethanal.\nFigure 18.5  The ‘before’ and \n‘after’ observations when \nFehling’s solution is warmed with \nan aldehyde, such as ethanal.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n5\t \u0007The melting points of the derivatives of the reaction \nbetween 2,4-DNPH and various aldehydes and ketones \nare shown in the table.\nProduct of reaction \nbetween 2,4-DNPH and ...\nMelting point / °C\nethanal \n168\npropanal \n155\nbutanal \n126\npropanone \n126\nbutanone \n116\n\u0007a\t \u0007What would be observed when each of the \ncarbonyl compounds in the table is mixed with  \n2,4-DNPH?\n\u0007b\t \u0007A derivative was formed between 2,4-DNPH and an \nunknown carbonyl compound.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007The melting point of the derivative was 126 °C. \nWhat does this result tell you?\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007The unknown carbonyl compound formed an \norange precipitate when warmed with Fehling’s \nsolution.

This  \noxidation forms a methyl ketone, RCOCH3, which then \nreacts via the two steps shown above to give the yellow  \ntri-iodomethane precipitate, CHI3.\nYou should note that there are two organic products \nformed in this reaction: one is tri-iodomethane and the  \nother is the sodium salt of a carboxylic acid.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nQuestion\n6\t \u0007a\t \u0007i\t\n\u0007When propanone is warmed with alkaline \niodine solution, a yellow precipitate is formed. \nName and draw the displayed formula of the \nyellow precipitate.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007Give the structural formulae of the organic \nproducts formed in both steps of the reaction \nin part i.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Explain, naming any organic products formed, why \nethanol gives a positive test when warmed with \nalkaline iodine solution.\nc\t\n\u0007Which of these compounds will give a yellow \nprecipitate when treated with alkaline aqueous \niodine?\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007butanone\t\n\u0007iv\t \u0007pentan-2-one\n\u0007ii\t \u0007butanal\t\n\u0007v\t\n\u0007ethanal\n\u0007iii\t \u0007pentan-3-one\t\n\u0007vi\t \u0007methanal\nInfra-red spectroscopy\nIn infra-red spectroscopy a sample being analysed is \nirradiated with electromagnetic waves in the infra-red \nregion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The machine used \nis called a spectrophotometer, and it detects the intensity \nof the wavelengths of infra-red radiation that passes \nthrough the sample.\nThis analytical technique is particularly useful for \norganic chemists because all organic molecules absorb \nradiation in the infra-red range of wavelengths. The energy \nabsorbed corresponds to changes in the vibration of the \nbonds between atoms. The bonds can vibrate by stretching, \nbending and twisting. They have a natural frequency at \nwhich they vibrate. If we irradiate the molecules with \nenergy that corresponds to this frequency, it stimulates \nlarger vibrations and energy is absorbed. This is called the \nresonance frequency of that vibration. \nEach type of vibration will absorb characteristic \nwavelengths of infra-red radiation. These are often \nexpressed as the reciprocal of the wavelength in a unit \ncalled wavenumbers (measured in cm–1). We cannot be \ntoo specific when quoting the characteristic absorption \nfrequency of a bond – the nature of the rest of the molecule \nshifts the energy absorbed in each particular molecule. \nHowever, we can say, for example, that the amine group  \n(\n NH2) absorbs in the range 3300 to 3500 cm–1.\nTherefore we can identify the presence (or absence) of \ndifferent functional groups from the absorbance pattern \non an infra-red spectrum.

That is why we \nneed to use a variety of techniques, such as NMR, infra-\nred spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, to work out the \nstructure of a new organic compound (see Chapter 29).\nAs well as their wavenumber bands, particular \nabsorbances have characteristic widths (broad or sharp \npeaks) and intensities (strong or weak) on the infra-red \nspectrum.

For example, \nwe might want to investigate a precipitation reaction \nto find out how the concentration of a reactant affects \nthe rate at which the precipitate forms. You might have \nseen the reaction between sodium thiosulfate and dilute \nhydrochloric acid, which is a commonly investigated \nprecipitation reaction. Sulfur is the precipitate formed:\nNa2S2O3(aq)  +  2HCl(aq)\n2NaCl(aq)  +  S(s)  +  H2O(l)  +  SO2(g)\nThis type of investigation involves changing only the \nvariable under investigation (in this case the concentration \nof a reactant) and keeping all other relevant variables \nconstant. We can judge the effect of changing the \nconcentration by devising a way to measure how quickly \nthe precipitate forms, such as timing how long it takes for \nthe solution to become opaque.\nWe now have the question we are investigating and the \nstructure of the investigation in terms of its key variables:\nIn a precipitation reaction, how does the concentration of \na reactant affect the rate of precipitation (as measured by \nthe time it takes for the solution to become opaque)?\n\nPractical skills 1\nFigure P1.1  Chemist performing a titration.\n■\n■\nThe independent variable is the one under investigation, \nwhich is changed systematically and for which we can \nchoose different values (in this case, the concentration  \nof reactant).\n■\n■\nThe dependent variable is the one we measure to judge the \neffect of changing the independent variable (in this case, \nthe time it takes for the solution to become opaque).\n247\n■\n■\nThe control variables are those that we must keep  \nconstant to ensure a fair test is carried out (in this case, \nwe should control the temperature and total volume of \nreactants used).\nNote that we can express the question in this type of \ninvestigation generally as:\nHow does the independent variable affect the dependent \nvariable?\nWhen asked to plan and/or carry out an investigation, it is \nimportant that you state the question under investigation \nclearly and list the independent, dependent and control \nvariables before you start writing down your proposed \nmethod or planning how to record and present your results.\nThe type of variable under investigation will determine \nwhether you display the data collected in a table as a line \ngraph or as a bar chart. To decide which type of graph  \nto draw, you need to know the difference between \ncontinuous variables – which are measured so can have any \nnumerical value within the range of results – and categoric\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nvariables – which are described by words. We can assume \nthat the dependent variable is continuous, as it measures \nthe effect of varying the independent variable. Then if the \nindependent variable is continuous, we draw a line graph. \nIf the independent variable is categoric, we draw a bar \nchart. So if you investigate the effect of temperature on \nrate of reaction, the data can be presented as a line graph, \nwhereas if you investigate the rate of different metals \nreacting with dilute acid, the data can be presented as a bar \nchart (as there are no values between those chosen for the \nindependent variable). See the graphs in Figure P1.2.\nIn the Cambridge International AS and A Level \nAdvanced Practical Skills examination (Paper 3), you will \nneed to follow instructions to carry out an investigation \ninto an unknown substance or mixture of substances. \nAlways read through all of the instructions before carrying \nout the tests. Testing for unknown substances will require \nyou to describe your observations in detail. You will be able \nto refer to tables of tests for cations, anions and gases in the \nQualitative Analysis Notes in your examination paper (see \nAppendix 3, page 475) to draw your conclusions.\nYou will also carry out a quantitative task (based on \nmeasurements) rather than a qualitative task (based on \nobservations). Examples of problems that need you to \ncollect quantitative data could be a titration (a volumetric \nanalysis) or an enthalpy change experiment. This type \nof task will require you to read scales on measuring \ninstruments such as burettes, measuring cylinders, gas \nsyringes and balances.

Ideally you should be aiming for two concordant \ntitres with the same values – but judging the end-point can \nbe tricky.

Generally, the independent variable goes in the first \ncolumn and the dependent variable goes in the second \ncolumn. Sometimes, if space on the page is an issue, a table \ncan be organised horizontally. In this case, the independent \nvariable again goes first but at the start of the first row in \nthe table, with the dependent variable beneath it, not next \nto it as in a conventional table.\n■\n■\nWhen recording quantitative data you will often need \ncolumns for repeat results and calculations of the mean. This \nis achieved by subdividing the column for the dependent \nvariable into the required number of columns. For example, \nin the rate of precipitation investigation described at the \nbeginning of this chapter, the table to record three repeat \nreadings and their means would be organised as:\nConcentration / \nmol dm–3\nTime for reaction mixture to turn \nopaque / s\n1st test\n2nd test\n3rd test\nMean\n■\n■\nNote that the headings in the table have their units included \n– therefore you do not need to record the units for each \nentry you make in the table.\n■\n■\nOn graphs, always plot the independent variable along \nthe horizontal (x) axis and the dependent variable up the \nvertical (y) axis.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n■\n■\nDraw the lines in tables and graphs in pencil, labelling the \naxes as in the corresponding table headings with their units.\n■\n■\nIn the table above, there could be an extra column on the \nright-hand side for values of the reciprocal of the mean  \ntime taken for the reaction mixture to become opaque \n(headed ‘1 / time’). This could be plotted on a graph of  \n1/time against concentration to see how the rate of reaction \nvaries with temperature (as rate is proportional to 1/time, \nso the greater the time, the slower the rate). See the graphs \nin Figure P1.4.\n■\n■\nThe labelled axes must be longer than half the size of the \ngraph grid in both directions, selecting a sensible scale (e.g. \n1, 2 or 5 units per 20 mm square on the grid – not 3 units).\n■\n■\nThe points should be plotted as small, neat x’s with a sharp \npencil. The line drawn through the points should not be \n‘dot-to-dot’ but should be a line of best fit – either drawn \nwith a ruler for a straight line or a smooth free-hand line for \na curve. Think of the best-fit line as the ‘average’ line though \nthe points.\n■\n■\nAlways show your working out in calculations.\n■\n■\nOnly give answers produced by calculation to correspond \nto the number of significant figures of the least accurate \nexperimental data used. So if calculating a concentration \nusing titre volumes such as 15.35 cm3, then the value of  \nthe concentration of the unknown solution can be given to  \n4 significant figures (e.g. 1.244 or 0.9887 mol dm–3). \nHowever, if the known concentration of one of the reactants \nis given to three significant figures (e.g. 0.0250 mol dm−3 or \n0.200 mol dm−3), then the calculated concentration could be \ngiven to three or four significant figures.\n■\n■\nWhen recording qualitative descriptions in a table, if there is \n‘no change visible’, write that and do not just put in a dash.\nquestion\n3\t \u0007In an experiment to find the enthalpy change of a \nreaction between two solutions, the mass of solutions \nmixed together was 50.0 g and the temperature \nincreased by 7.5 °C.

Then construct a right-angled \ntriangle, as shown in Figure P1.5. The gradient tells us \nthe rate of change of y (the dependent variable) per unit \nchange of x (the independent variable):\ngradient = ​ change in y \n__________ \nchange in x ​\nWhen evaluating the quality of the data collected, there \nare two types of error to consider: random errors and \nsystematic errors. Whenever we carry out an experiment \nthere are always errors involved. They might be due to \nthe experimenter not reading the scale on a measuring \ninstrument correctly or choosing a measuring instrument \nwith an inappropriate scale. These examples of human \nerror could equally make the values of data too high or \ntoo low, so they are called random errors. Repeating tests \nand taking the mean value helps to reduce the effect of \nrandom errors.\nHowever, other errors can result in consistently high \nor low values being recorded. These are called systematic \nerrors. Examples would be reading the volume of liquid\n\nread values\nfrom the y-axis\ny\nchange in y\nchange in x\nx\nread values\nfrom the x-axis\nFigure P1.5  Finding the gradient of a straight-line graph. \nChoosing to construct a large triangle reduces the percentage \nerror in the values read from the axes, which are then used to \ncalculate the gradient.\nin a burette to the upper level of the liquid instead of to \nthe bottom of the meniscus. It should noted though that \nthese consistently high measurements of volume would \nnot result in an incorrect value for the titre, because the \nfinal volume is subtracted from the initial volume. Not \nensuring the measuring instrument is correctly set on \nzero is another example of a systematic error, which if not \ncorrected during an investigation can result in consistently \nhigh or low masses being measured on balances.\nOther systematic errors can be caused by errors when \nplanning an investigation. This might result in data being \ncollected that does not really answer the question under \ninvestigation. For example, a control variable might not \nbe kept constant or taken into account, or the dependent \nvariable chosen might not be a true measure of the effect \nof varying the independent variable. Such error will make \nthe data collected invalid.\nYou will have to estimate the error inherent in reading \nscales, as described at the beginning of this chapter, and \nthe evaluation is the place to discuss the effect these \nmeasurement errors might have on the validity of the data \nand conclusions you can draw from them. In the example \nof a thermometer with 1 °C calibration marks, you can \nquote values to the nearest 0.5 °C. The actual effect of this \nmargin of error on confidence levels will depend on the \nmagnitude of the temperature being measured. When \nreading a low temperature of, say, 5.0 °C, plus or minus\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n0.5 °C will have a bigger effect than when reading a higher \ntemperature, such as 92.5 °C. For this reason it is best to \nquote percentage errors, worked out using the equation:\npercentage error = ​ \nmargin of error \n \n________________________ \n \n \nactual or mean measurement ​ × 100%\nworked example\nIn the case of the two temperatures 5 °C and 92.5 °C, for \n5 °C the percentage error will be:\n​ 0.5 × 100 \n________ \n5 \n​ = 10%\nwhereas for 92.5 °C the percentage error is:\n​ 0.5 × 100 \n________ \n92.5  ​ = 0.54%\nSo there is a significant error in reading 5 °C compared \nwith reading 92.5 °C.\nIn enthalpy change investigations you often have to \nmeasure temperature differences, subtracting the final \ntemperature from the initial temperature. In this case, \nusing the thermometer just described, the error would \nbe plus or minus 1 °C, as the two 0.5 °C margins of error \nshould be added together. In this case you should suggest \nincreasing the temperature change. For example, when \nevaluating enthalpies of combustion of alcohols by heating \nwater in a copper calorimeter, you could use a smaller \nvolume of water to heat. However, this change would have \nto be balanced against the increase in percentage error in \nmeasuring the smaller volume of water, to see which gives \nthe least percentage error overall.\nYou might need to suggest how to make your data \nmore accurate. For example, in the rate of precipitation \ninvestigation you could improve the accuracy of judging \nthe time when the reaction reaches a certain point in each \ntest carried out. Whereas judging the moment when a \npencil mark can no longer be seen through the reaction \nmixture is subjective, you could use a light source and \nlightmeter to make more objective judgements. You could \nstop the timer when the level of light passing through the \nreaction mixture drops to the same level as measured by \nthe lightmeter in each test. This will make your repeat (or \nreplicate) data more precise and improve the accuracy of \nyour results.\nYour evaluation might lead beyond suggestions to \nchange the method to ideas to investigate new questions. \nFor example, evaluating the rate of precipitation, you will \nhave tried to control the temperature – probably by ensuring \nboth solutions started mixing at the same temperature. \nHowever, if the reaction is exothermic, this might cause the\n\nPractical skills 1\ntemperature to change between the different concentrations \ninvestigated. This could lead to a new investigation to \ncompare the energy transferred in a precipitation reaction at \ndifferent concentrations. The question could be phrased as \n‘How does the concentration of a reactant solution affect the \nenergy transferred in the reaction?’.\nWhen drawing conclusions from investigations \ninvolving the manipulation of variables, you should refer to \nyour graph when commenting on the relationship between \nthe independent and dependent variables, explaining your \nfindings using the data and your scientific knowledge and \nunderstanding. When drawing conclusions from qualitative \ntests to identify an unknown substance, where possible try \nto carry out or suggest a further confirmatory test for the \nsame substance from the table provided in Paper 3.\nAny hypotheses you were testing can only be refuted \n(disproved) by a practical investigation you carry out; \nthey cannot be proved because of the limitations of your \ninvestigation. So hypotheses can only be ‘supported’ by \nthe data collected. If your hypothesis predicts that the rate \nof reaction increases with increasing concentration, with \na justification using collision theory, and data from your \ninvestigation supports this, you cannot say whether this \nrelationship is true beyond the range of concentrations \ntested. There might be a point at higher concentrations \nwhere increasing the concentration of one reactant \nwill start to have less, or even no, effect because there \nis such excess that the rate of collisions with the other \nreactant particles is not affected by further increases of \nconcentration – so this would give you another idea to test!\n253\nquestion\n4\t \u0007a\t \u0007A student measured the average rate of a reaction \nby timing how long it took to collect 20 cm3 of the \ngas liberated in the reaction.

The reaction is highly exothermic. The \nenergy given out when ions of opposite charges come together \nto form a crystalline lattice is called the lattice energy, ΔH \nO\n—\nlatt.\nEquations describing the lattice energy of sodium \nchloride and magnesium chloride are shown here.\n258\nLattice energy is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of an \nionic compound is formed from its gaseous ions under \nstandard conditions.\nNa+(g) + Cl–(g)  \n  NaCl(s)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nlatt = –787 kJ mol–1\nMg2+(g) + 2Cl–(g)  \n  MgCl2(s)\b ΔH \nO\n—\nlatt = –2526 kJ mol–1\nNote that:\n■\n■\nit is the gaseous ions that combine to form the ionic solid\n■\n■\nthe lattice energy is always exothermic: the value of  \nΔH O\n—\nlatt is always negative, because the definition specifies \nthe bonding together of ions, not the separation of ions.\nThe large exothermic value of the lattice energy shows that \nthe ionic lattice is very stable with respect to its gaseous \nions. The more exothermic the lattice energy, the stronger \nthe ionic bonding in the lattice.\nIt is impossible to determine the lattice energy of a \ncompound by a single direct experiment. We can, however, \ncalculate a value for ΔH \nO\n—\nlatt using several experimental \nvalues and an energy cycle called a Born–Haber cycle. In \norder to do this, we first need to introduce two more types \nof enthalpy change.\n\nNote that the quantity we have defined as lattice energy \nis more accurately called the lattice enthalpy. However, \nthe term lattice energy is commonly applied to lattice \nenthalpy as well. Lattice energy is the internal energy \nchange when 1 mole of an ionic compound is formed from \nits gaseous ions at 0 K. Lattice enthalpy values are very \nclose to the corresponding lattice energy values.\nQuestion\n1\t a\t \u0007Give values for the standard conditions of \ntemperature and pressure.\nb\t Write equations describing the lattice energy of:\ni\t\nmagnesium oxide\nii\t potassium bromide\niii\t sodium sulfide.\nEnthalpy change of atomisation \nand electron affinity\nEnthalpy change of atomisation\nThe standard enthalpy change of atomisation, ΔH O\n—\nat, is \nthe enthalpy change when 1 mole of gaseous atoms is \nformed from its element under standard conditions.\nThe standard enthalpy change of atomisation of lithium \nrelates to the equation:\nLi(s)  \n  Li(g)\t\nΔH \nO\n—\nat  = +161 kJ mol–1\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of atomisation of chlorine \nrelates to the equation:\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2(g)  \n  Cl(g)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nat = +122 kJ mol–1\nValues of ΔH \nO\n—\nat are always positive (endothermic) because \nenergy must be supplied to break the bonds holding the \natoms in the element together.\nQuestion\n2\t a\t \u0007The bond energy of the chlorine molecule is \n+244 kJ mol–1.

Explain your answer.\nElectron affinity\nThe energy change occurring when a gaseous non-metal \natom accepts one electron is called the electron affinity. \nThe symbol for electron affinity is ΔH \nO\n—\nea.\nThe first electron affinity, ΔH O\n—\nea1, is the enthalpy change\nwhen 1 mole of electrons is added to 1 mole of  \ngaseous atoms to form 1 mole of gaseous 1– ions under \nstandard conditions.\nEquations representing the first electron affinity of \nchlorine and sulfur are:\nCl(g)  +  e–  \n  Cl–(g)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nea1 = –348 kJ mol–1\nS(g)  +  e–  \n  S–(g)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nea1 = –200 kJ mol–1\nNote that:\n■\n■\nthe change is from gaseous atoms to gaseous 1– ions\n■\n■\nthe enthalpy change for the first electron affinity, ΔH O\n—\nea1 is \ngenerally exothermic: ΔH O\n—\nea is negative.\nWhen an element forms an ion with more than one \nnegative charge, we must use successive electron affinities \n(this is rather like the successive ionisation energies we \nused on page 34). The 1st, 2nd and 3rd electron affinities \nhave symbols ΔH \nO\n—\nea1, ΔH \nO\n—\nea2 and ΔH \nO\n—\nea3.\n\nChapter 19: Lattice energy\nThe second electron affinity, ΔH O\n—\nea2, is the enthalpy \nchange when 1 mole of electrons is added to 1 mole of \ngaseous 1– ions to form 1 mole of gaseous 2– ions under \nstandard conditions.\nThe equations representing the 1st and 2nd electron \naffinities of oxygen are:\n1st electron affinity: \nO(g)  +  e–  \n  O–(g) ΔH \nO\n—\nea1 = –141 kJ mol–1\n2nd electron affinity: \nO–(g)  +  e–  \n  O2–(g) ΔH \nO\n—\nea2 = +798 kJ mol–1\nNote that 2nd electron affinities are always endothermic \n(ΔH \nO\n—\nea2 is positive), and so are 3rd electron affinities.\nThe overall enthalpy change in forming an oxide ion, \nO2–, from an oxygen atom is found by adding together the \n1st and 2nd electron affinities:\nO(g)  +  2e–  \n  O2–(g)\nΔH \nO\n—\nea1  +  ΔH \nO\n—\nea2 = (–141)  +  (+798) = +657 kJ mol–1\n259\nQuestion\n3\t a\t \u0007Suggest why the 2nd and 3rd electron affinities are \nalways endothermic.\nb\t \u0007The 1st electron affinity of sulfur is –200 kJ mol–1. \nThe second electron affinity of sulfur is \n+640 kJ mol–1.

The size and charge of these ions can \naffect the value of the lattice energy.\nLattice energy and ion size\nAs the size of the ion increases, the lattice energy becomes \nless exothermic. This applies to both anions and cations. \nFigure 19.6 shows that:\n■\n■\nfor any given anion, e.g. F –, the lattice energy gets less \nexothermic as the size of the cation increases from Li+ to Cs+\n■\n■\nfor any given cation, e.g. Li+, the lattice energy gets less \nexothermic as the size of the anion increases from F– to I–.\n–1100\nLi+\n–1000\nLattice enthalpy/ kJmol–1\nNa+\n–900\nRb+\nK+\n–800\nCs+\n–700\n–600\nCl–\nBr–\nI–\nF–\n0\n.\nFigure 19.6  Lattice enthalpies of the Group 1 halides.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nIons with the same ionic charge have a lower charge density \nif their radius is larger. This is because the same charge is \nspread out over a larger volume. A lower charge density \nresults in weaker electrostatic forces of attraction in the \nionic lattice. Sodium fluoride has a less exothermic lattice \nenergy than lithium fluoride. This reflects the lower charge \ndensity on sodium ions compared with lithium ions.\nLattice energy and charge on the ions\nThe lattice energy becomes more exothermic as the ionic \ncharge increases.\nWe can see this by comparing lithium fluoride, LiF, \nwith magnesium oxide, MgO. These compounds have the \nsame arrangement of ions in their lattice structure. The \ncations Li+ and Mg2+ have similar sizes. The anions F – \nand O2– are fairly similar in size (although they are much \nlarger than the cations). The major physical difference \nbetween LiF and MgO is the ionic charge. This affects the \nlattice energy:\nΔH \nO\n—\nlatt [LiF] = –1049 kJ mol–1\nΔH \nO\n—\nlatt [MgO] = –3923 kJ mol–1\nMagnesium oxide has a greater lattice energy than \nlithium fluoride. The doubly charged Mg2+ and O2– ions \nin magnesium oxide attract each other more strongly  \nthan the singly charged ions of the same size in LiF. \nFor ions of similar size, the greater the ionic charge, the \nhigher the charge density. This results in stronger ionic \nbonds being formed.\nquestions\n8\t a\t \u0007For each pair of compounds, suggest which will have \nthe most exothermic lattice energy.\ni\t\nKCl and BaO (ionic radii are similar)\nii\t MgI2 and SrI2\n\t\n\t\niii\t CaO and NaCl (ionic radii are similar).\nb\t \u0007Place the following compounds in order of \nincreasingly exothermic lattice energy.

Use this relationship to explain why:\na\t \u0007magnesium oxide has a greater lattice energy than \nlithium fluoride\nb\t \u0007lithium fluoride has a greater lattice energy than \npotassium bromide.\nIon polarisation\nIn our model of an ionic lattice, we have thought of the \nions as being spherical in shape. This is not always the \ncase. In some cases, the positive charge on the cation in an \nionic lattice may attract the electrons in the anion towards \nit. This results in a distortion of the electron cloud of the \nanion and the anion is no longer spherical (Figure 19.7). \nWe call this distortion ion polarisation. The ability of a \ncation to attract electrons and distort an anion is called \nthe polarising power of the cation.\n2+\n–\n263\nFigure 19.7  Ion polarisation. A small highly charged cation \ncan distort the shape of the anion.\nFactors affecting ion polarisation\nThe degree of polarisation of an anion depends on:\n■\n■\nthe charge density of the cation\n■\n■\nthe ease with which the anion can be polarised  \n– its polarisability.\nAn anion is more likely to be polarised if:\n■\n■\nthe cation is small\n■\n■\nthe cation has a charge of 2+ or 3+\n■\n■\nthe anion is large\n■\n■\nthe anion has a charge of 2– or 3–.\nA small highly charged cation such as Fe3+ can attract \nelectrons and distort a larger anion to such an extent \nthat the bond formed has a considerable amount of \ncovalent character. Pure ionic bonding and pure covalent \nbonding are extremes. Many ionic compounds have some \ncovalent character due to ion polarisation. Many covalent \ncompounds have some degree of charge separation, i.e. \nthey are polar, due to bond polarisation (see Chapter 4, \npages 60–61).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n10\t a\t \u0007Explain why a cation with a smaller ionic radius \nhas a higher charge density.\nb\t \u0007Which one of the following ions will be the  \nbest polariser of the large nitrate ion?

No metallic salts are absolutely insoluble in water. \nEven lead carbonate, which is regarded as insoluble, \ndissolves to a very small extent: 0.000 17 g dissolves in \nevery dm3 of water. If salts were completely insoluble they \ncould not have a value for ΔH \nO\n—\nsol.\n265\nEnthalpy change of hydration\nThe lattice energy for sodium chloride is –788 kJ mol–1. \nThis means that we need to supply (at least) +788 kJ mol–1 \nto overcome the forces of attraction between the ions. But \nΔH \nO\n—\nsol [NaCl] is only +3.9 kJ mol–1. Where does the energy \nneeded to separate the ions come from? The answer is that \nit comes from the strong attraction between the ions and \nthe water molecules.\nWhen an ionic solid dissolves in water, bonds are \nformed between water molecules and the ions. These \nbonds are called ion–dipole bonds. Water is a polar \nmolecule. The δ– oxygen atoms in water molecules are \nattracted to the positive ions in the ionic compound. The \nδ+ hydrogen atoms in water molecules are attracted to the \nnegative ions in the ionic compound (Figure 19.9).\nnew bonds\nformed\nδ+\nHδ+\nδ–\nδ–\n–\nFigure 19.9  a  Water molecules \nforming

is \nsufficient to compensate for the energy that must be put \nin to separate the anions and cations that are bonded \ntogether in the crystal lattice.\nThe energy released when gaseous ions dissolve

For example, \nwhen a copper rod is placed in contact with an aqueous \nsolution of its ions the following equilibrium exists:\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Cu(s)\nThere are two opposing reactions in this equilibrium.\n■\n■\nMetal atoms from the rod entering the solution as metal \nions.

We cannot measure this potential \ndirectly. But we can measure the difference in potential \nbetween the metal/metal ion system and another system. We \ncall this value the electrode potential, E. Electrode potential \nis measured in volts. The system we use for comparison is the \nstandard hydrogen electrode.\nIt is thought that the absolute electrical potentials \nthat we cannot measure are caused by the formation of \nan electrical double layer when an element is placed in a \nsolution of its ions. For example, when zinc is placed in a \nsolution containing zinc ions, a tiny number of zinc atoms \non the surface of the metal are converted to zinc ions, \nwhich go into solution. This leaves an excess of electrons \non the surface of the zinc. The solution around the metal \nnow has excess Zn2+ ions. Some of these cations near \nthe surface of the zinc are attracted to its surface. So an \nelectrical double layer is formed. This build up of charge \ncauses an electric potential (voltage) between the metal \nand the metal ions in solution (Figure 20.4).\n2+ = Zn2+ ions\nzinc rod\nZnSO4(aq)\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\nFigure 20.4  The separation of charge when a zinc rod is \nplaced in a solution of Zn2+ ions results in an electrical  \ndouble layer.\n\nChapter 20: Electrochemistry\nThe standard hydrogen electrode\nThe standard hydrogen electrode is one of several \ntypes of half-cell that can be used as reference \nelectrodes.

Redox \nequilibria are no different. When we compare the voltage \nof a standard half-cell, X, with a standard hydrogen \nelectrode, we are measuring E \nO\n—\n    for the half-cell X. If we \nchange the concentration or temperature of half-cell X, \nthe electrode potential also changes. Under these non-\nstandard conditions we use the symbol E for the  \nelectrode potential.\nWhat happens to the electrode potential when we \nchange the concentration of ions in a half-cell? Let us take \nan example of a metal/metal ion equilibrium:\nZn2+(aq)  +  e–  \n  Zn(s)\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = –0.76 V\n■\n■\nIf [Zn2+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm–3, the value of E \nbecomes less negative / more positive (for example −0.61 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Zn2+] is less than 1.00 mol dm–3, the value of E becomes more \nnegative / less positive (for example −0.80 V).\nWe can apply Le Chatelier’s principle to redox equilibria.  \nIf we increase the concentration of the species on the  \nleft of the equation, the position of equilibrium will  \nshift to the right. So the value of E becomes more positive / \nless negative.\nIf two different ions are present in the half-cell, we have \nto consider both ions.\nLet us take the equilibrium between Fe3+ ions and Fe2+ \nions as an example.\nFe3+  +  e–  \n  Fe2+\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.77 V\n1.00 mol dm–3\t\n1.00 mol dm–3\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n■\n■\nIf [Fe3+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm –3  \n(keeping [Fe2+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes \nmore positive (for example +0.85 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Fe3+] is less than 1.00 mol dm–3  \n(keeping [Fe2+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes less \npositive (for example +0.70 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Fe2+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm–3  \n(keeping [Fe3+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes less \npositive (for example +0.70 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Fe2+] is less than 1.00 mol dm–3  \n(keeping [Fe3+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes \nmore positive (for example +0.85 V).\nYou can see from the above that if we increase the \nconcentration of both the Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions, these effects \nmay cancel each other out.\nHow can we predict whether or not a given reaction \nwill occur under non-standard conditions? The answer \nis that if the E \nO\n—\n    values of the two half-reactions involved \ndiffer by more than 0.30 V, then the reaction predicted by \nthe E \nO\n—\n    values is highly likely to occur. So chlorine is likely \nto oxidise Fe2+ ions even if the conditions are not standard. \nThis is because the difference in their E \nO\n—\n    values is 0.59 V, \nwhich is considerably greater than 0.30 V.\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2(g)  +  e–  \n  Cl– (aq)\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.36 V\nFe3+(aq)  +  e–  \n  Fe2+(aq)\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.77 V\nWe cannot, however, predict with confidence whether the \nreaction between MnO4\n– ions and Cl2 will take place if the \nconditions are too far from standard.\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–  \n  Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.52 V\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2(g)  +  e–  \n  Cl–(aq)\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.36 V\nThis is because the difference in E \nO\n—\n    values is 0.16 V, which \nis considerably smaller than 0.30 V.\nThe figure 0.30 V given here to enable us to tell if a \nreaction will still occur under non-standard conditions is a \nrough guide only.

The concentration \nof hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions in pure water (and  \nhence the value of Kc) is extremely small. Because of this, \nwe can regard the concentration of water as being constant.\n\nFigure 21.1  Compost in a compost bin. The pH of compost \nchanges as the plant material is broken down by bacterial \naction. The chemical reactions in compost involve weak acids \nand weak bases.\nWe can therefore incorporate this into the value of Kc.

This is because methyl red changes colour \nbetween pH 4.2 and pH 6.3, values that correspond \nwith the region of sharpest pH change. Phenolphthalein \nwould not be a suitable indicator to use because it only \nchanges colour in alkaline regions (pH 8.2–10) that do not \ncorrespond to the sharp pH change. The phenolphthalein \nwould change colour only gradually as more and more \nacid is added, instead of changing suddenly on the \naddition of a single drop at the end-point.\n\nWeak acids with strong bases\nFigure 21.10 shows how the pH changes when \n0.100 mol dm–3 aqueous sodium hydroxide (a strong base) \nis titrated with 0.100 mol dm–3 benzoic acid (a weak acid).\n14\n12\n10\npH of flask contents\n8\n7\n6\n4\n2\n0\nVolume of weak acid added to strong base /cm3\n0\n4\n8\n12\n16\n20\n24\n28\n32\nFigure 21.10  A typical weak acid–strong base titration.\nThese results show:\n■\n■\na sharp fall in the graph line between pH 11 and pH 7.5\n■\n■\nthat the midpoint of the steep slope is at about pH 9.\nBecause there is a sharp change in pH over the region  \npH 7.5 to 11 we can use phenolphthalein as an indicator \nfor this titration.

A buffer solution is used to keep pH \n(almost) constant.\nOne type of buffer solution is a mixture of a weak acid \nand one of its salts. An example is an aqueous mixture of \nethanoic acid and sodium ethanoate. Mixtures of ethanoic \nacid and sodium ethanoate in different proportions act as \nbuffers between pH values of 4 and 7. We can understand \nhow a buffer solution works by referring to the equilibria \ninvolved.\nEthanoic acid is a weak acid. So it stays mostly in the \nun-ionised form (CH3COOH) and only gives rise to a low \nconcentration of ethanoate ions in solution:\nCH3COOH(aq)  \n  H+(aq)  +  CH3COO–(aq)\nethanoic acid\t\nethanoate ion\n\nChapter 21: Further aspects of equilibria\nFigure 21.12  The pH of this agar plate for growing bacteria is \nkept constant by using a buffer solution. The buffer solution is \nincorporated in the agar jelly used to make the plate.\nSodium ethanoate is fully ionised in aqueous solution:\nCH3COONa(s)  +  aq  \n  Na+(aq)  +  CH3COO–(aq)\nsodium ethanoate\t\nethanoate ion\nThe buffer solution contains relatively high concentrations \nof both CH3COOH and CH3COO–. We say that there are \nreserve supplies of the acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate \nbase (CH3COO–). The pH of a buffer solution depends \non the ratio of the concentration of the acid and the \nconcentration of its conjugate base. If this does not change \nvery much, the pH changes very little.\nIn the buffer solution ethanoic acid molecules are in \nequilibrium with hydrogen ions and ethanoate ions:\n313\nCH3COOH(aq)  \n  H+(aq)  +  CH3COO–(aq)\nrelatively high\t\nrelatively high \n\t\nconcentration\t\nconcentration \n\t\nof ethanoic acid\t\nof ethanoate ions\nWe can use this equation to explain how buffer  \nsolutions work.\nAn increase in hydrogen ion concentration would \ngreatly lower the pH of water, but when H+ ions are added \nto the buffer solution:\n■\n■\naddition of H+ ions shifts the position of equilibrium to the \nleft because H+ ions combine with CH3COO– ions to form more \nCH3COOH until equilibrium is re-established\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COO– ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COO– ions in solution does not  \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COOH ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COOH molecules in solution does not \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nso the pH does not change significantly.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nAn increase in hydroxide ion concentration would greatly \nincrease the pH of water, but when OH– ions are added to \nthe buffer solution:\n■\n■\nthe added OH– ions combine with H+ ions to form water\n■\n■\nthis reduces the H+ ion concentration\n■\n■\nthe position of equilibrium shifts to the right\n■\n■\nso CH3COOH molecules ionise to form more H+ and \nCH3COO– ions until equilibrium is re-established\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COOH ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COOH molecules in solution does not \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COO– ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COO– ions in solution does not  \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nso the pH does not change significantly.\nIn unpolluted regions of the Earth, rainwater has a pH \nof 5.7. This is because carbon dioxide dissolves in the \nrainwater to form a dilute solution of the weak acid \ncarbonic acid, H2CO3. This acid and its conjugate base, \nHCO3\n–, act as a buffer solution. It minimises changes in \npH if very small amounts of acid or alkali are added to the \nrainwater. But in regions where there is pollution caused \nby the emission of acidic oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, the \npH of the rainwater falls to around 4. The rainwater can \nno longer act as a buffer because the concentrations of the \nH2CO3 and HCO3\n– are not high enough to cope with the \nlarge amounts of acidic pollution involved.\nNo buffer solution can cope with the excessive addition \nof acids or alkalis. If very large amounts of acid or alkali \nare added, the pH will change significantly.\nBuffer solutions that resist changes in pH in alkaline \nregions are usually a mixture of a weak base and its \nconjugate acid. An example is a mixture of aqueous \nammonia with ammonium chloride.\nAqueous ammonia is a weak base, so there is only a low \nconcentration of ammonium ions in ammonia solution:\n314\nNH3(aq)  +  H2O(l)   \n   NH4\n+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nAmmonium chloride is fully ionised in aqueous  \nsolution.

They are also used to \nmake sure that pH meters record the correct pH.\nMany animals depend on buffers to keep a constant \npH in various parts of their bodies. In humans, the pH \nof the blood is kept between 7.35 and 7.45 by a number of \ndifferent buffers in the blood:\n■\n■\nhydrogencarbonate ions, HCO3\n–\n■\n■\nhaemoglobin and plasma proteins\n■\n■\ndihydrogenphosphate (H2PO4\n–) and hydrogenphosphate \n(HPO4\n2–) ions.\nThe cells in our body produce carbon dioxide as a product \nof aerobic respiration (the oxidation of glucose to provide \nenergy).

When the blood passes through the small \nblood vessels around our lungs hydrogencarbonate ions \nare rapidly converted to carbon dioxide and water. The \ncarbon dioxide escapes into the lungs.\nThe production of H+ ions, if left unchecked, would lower \nthe pH of the blood and cause ‘acidosis’. This may disrupt \nsome body functions and eventually lead to coma.

Some \nionic compounds, however, are insoluble or only slightly \nsoluble in water. But even ‘insoluble’ ionic compounds \nmay dissolve to a very small extent in water. Solubility \nis generally quoted as the number of grams or number \nof moles of compound needed to saturate 100 g or 1 kg \nof water at a given temperature. We say that a solution is \nsaturated when no more solute dissolves in it.\n316\n■\n■\nSodium chloride is regarded as a soluble salt: a saturated \nsolution contains 36 g per 100 g of water.\n■\n■\nLead(II) chloride is regarded as an insoluble salt: a saturated \nsolution contains 0.99 g per 100 g of water.\nSolubility product\nAn equilibrium is established when an undissolved \nionic compound is in contact with a saturated solution \nof its ions.

Values are quoted  \nat 298 K.\nSolubility product is the product of the concentrations \nof each ion in a saturated solution of a sparingly soluble \nsalt at 298 K, raised to the power of their relative \nconcentrations.\nKsp = [Cy+(aq)]a[Ax–(aq)]b\nwhere a is the number of C y+ cations in one formula unit \nof the compound and b is the number of Ax– anions in one \nformula unit of the compound\nSo for Fe2S3 (which contains Fe3+ ions and S2– ions) the \nequilibrium is:\nFe2S3(s)  \n  2Fe3+(aq)  +  3S2–(aq)\nand the equilibrium expression is:\nKsp = [Fe3+(aq)]2[S2–(aq)]3\nThe idea of solubility product only applies to ionic \ncompounds that are only slightly soluble.\nThe units of solubility product depend on the number \nof each type of ion present in solution. You can work \nthe units out in the same way as for general equilibrium \nexpressions (see page 123), but you don’t have to do any \ncancelling.

For \nexample: will we get a precipitate when we mix a solution \nof barium chloride, BaCl2, with a very dilute solution of \nsodium carbonate?\nBoth barium chloride and sodium carbonate are \nsoluble salts, but barium carbonate is relatively insoluble. \nWe must consider the equilibrium for the insoluble salt \ndissolving in water:\n318\nBaCO3(s)  \n  Ba2+(aq)  +  CO3\n2–(aq)\nThe solubility product is given by:\nKsp = [Ba2+] [CO3\n2–] = 5.5 × 10–10 mol2 dm–6\nIf [Ba2+][CO3\n2–] is greater than 5.5 × 10–10 mol2 dm–6 a \nprecipitate will form.\nIf [Ba2+][CO3\n2–] is less than 5.5 × 10–10 mol2 dm–6 no \nprecipitate will form.\nworked example\n9\t Will a precipitate form if we mix equal volumes of \nsolutions of 1.00 × 10–4 mol dm–3 Na2CO3 and  \n5.00 × 10–5 mol dm–3 BaCl2?\n■\n■\n[Ba2+] = 2.50 × 10–5 mol dm–3\n■\n■\n[CO32–] = 5.00 × 10–5 mol dm–3\n[Ba2+] [CO32–]\t = (2.50 × 10–5) × (5.00 × 10–5)\n\t\n\t\n= 1.25 × 10–9 mol2 dm–6\nThis value is greater than the solubility product, so a \nprecipitate of barium carbonate forms.\n\nFigure 21.15  The shell of this nautilus is composed mainly of \ncalcium carbonate. The nautilus adjusts conditions so shell \nmaterial is formed when the concentration of calcium ions \nand carbonate ions in seawater are high enough to precipitate \ncalcium carbonate.\nThe common ion effect\nThe common ion effect is the reduction in the solubility \nof a dissolved salt achieved by adding a solution of \na compound which has an ion in common with the \ndissolved salt. This often results in precipitation.\nAn example of the common ion effect can be seen when we \nadd a solution of sodium chloride to a saturated solution of \nsilver chloride and silver chloride precipitates. Why is this?\nIn a saturated solution of silver chloride in water, we \nhave the following equilibrium:\nAgCl(s)  \n  Ag+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\nWe now add a solution of sodium chloride:\n■\n■\nthe chloride ion is common to both sodium chloride and \nsilver chloride\n■\n■\nthe added chloride ions shift the position of equilibrium to \nthe left\n■\n■\nsilver chloride is precipitated.\nThe addition of the common ion, Cl–, has reduced the \nsolubility of the silver chloride because its solubility \nproduct has been exceeded.

An example \nis the alkaline hydrolysis of bromobutane:\nC4H9Br  +  OH–  \n  C4H9OH  +  Br –\nSamples are removed at various times and \n‘quenched’ to stop or slow down the reaction, \ne.g. by cooling the sample in ice. The hydroxide \nion concentration can be found by titration with a \nstandard solution of a strong acid.\n2  Continuous\nIn this method a physical property of the reaction \nmixture is monitored over a period of time. Some \nexamples are using colorimetry, a conductivity meter \nor measuring changes in gas volume or gas pressure.\nColorimetry can be used to monitor the change in \ncolour of a particular reactant. For example, this \nmethod can be used to follow the reaction of iodine \nwith propanone:\n326\nCH3COCH3  +  I2  \n  CH3COCH2I  +  HI\nAs the reaction proceeds, the colour of the iodine \nfades.\nChanges in electrical conductivity of the solution can \nbe measured. For example, this method can be used \nto follow the reaction:\n(CH3)3CBr  +  H2O  \n  (CH3)3COH  +  H+  +  Br –\nAs the reaction proceeds, the electrical conductivity \nof the solution increases because ions are being \nformed in the reaction. This method can sometimes \nbe used even if there are ions on both sides of the \nequation. This is due to the fact that ions vary in their \nconductivities. For example the small H+ and OH– \nions have very high conductivities but Br – ions have a \nlow conductivity.\nChanges in gas volume or gas pressure can be \nmeasured. For example, this method can be used to \nfollow the reaction of benzenediazonium chloride, \nC6H5N   N+Cl–, with water.\nC6H5N   N+Cl–(aq)  +  H2O(l)\nC6H5OH(aq)  +  N2(g)  +  HCl(aq)\n\nFigure 22.2  A colorimeter can be used to monitor the \nprogress of a reaction. It measures the transmission of \nlight through a ‘cell’ containing the reaction mixture. The \nless concentrated the colour of the reaction mixture, the \nmore light is transmitted through the ‘cell’.\nThe reaction can be monitored by measuring the \nchange in volume of gas released with time. You \nmay have used this method to follow the rate \nof the reaction between calcium carbonate and \nhydrochloric acid. If you did, you will have measured \nthe change in volume of carbon dioxide gas released \nwith time.\nFigure 22.3  Rate of reaction can be followed by \nmeasuring the change in volume of a gas given off in a \nreaction. in this experiment CO2 is being given off when \nCaCO3 reacts with HCl.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nMethods for following the course of a reaction (continued)\nThe progress of some reactions can be followed \nby measuring small changes in the volume of the \nreaction mixture. For example, during the hydration \nof methylpropene, the volume decreases.\nH+\n(CH3)2C   CH2  +  H2O \n (CH3)3COH\nAn instrument called a dilatometer (Figure 22.4) is \nused to measure the small changes in volume.

In Chapter 6 (page 91) we used the symbol Δ \n(Greek capital ‘delta’) to represent a change in a particular \nquantity.

You will notice, however, that the graph is a curve \nwhich becomes shallower with time. So the rate decreases \nwith time. By measuring the change in concentration over \nshorter and shorter time intervals we get an increasingly \naccurate value of the reaction rate. If we make the time \ninterval over which we measure the reaction almost zero, \nwe obtain a reaction rate at a particular instant. We do this \nby drawing tangents at particular points on the curve.  \nLine B in Figure 22.5b shows a tangent drawn at the start \nof the curve. This gives a much more accurate value of the \ninitial rate of reaction.\nFigure 22.6 shows how to draw a tangent and  \ncalculate the rate at a particular point on a curve. In \nthis case, we are using a graph of concentration of \ncyclopropane against time.\nThe procedure is:\n■\n■\nSelect a point on the graph corresponding to a particular \ntime (10 minutes in this example).\n■\n■\nDraw a straight line at this point so that it just touches the \nline.

Rate \nequations are generally written without the × sign.  \nFor example:\nrate = k[cyclopropane]\nRate equations can only be determined from experimental \ndata. They cannot be found from the stoichiometric \nequation.\nSome experimentally determined rate equations are \nshown in Table 22.3.\nYou can see from equation 1 that the rate of reaction \nis proportional to the concentration of both H2 and I2; \nhowever, in equation 2, CO and O2 do not appear in \nthe rate equation, even though they are present in the \nstoichiometric equation.

For equation 2\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nin Table 22.3, the rate equation is rate = k[NO]2 and so the \norder is 2 with respect to [NO].\nWhen you are writing about order of reaction, you \nmust distinguish carefully between the order with respect \nto a particular reactant and the overall order of reaction. \nTaking equation 3 in Table 22.3 as an example:\nrate = k[H2] [NO]2\nWe say that this reaction is:\n■\n■\nfirst-order with respect to H2  \n(as rate is proportional to [H2]1)\n■\n■\nsecond-order with respect to NO  \n(as rate is proportional to [NO]2)\n■\n■\nthird-order overall (as the sum of the powers is 1 + 2  = 3).\nIn general terms, for a reaction A  +  B  \n  products, the \nrate equation can be written in the form:\nrate of reaction = k[A]m[B]n\nIn this equation:\n■\n■\n[A] and [B] are the concentrations of the reactants\n■\n■\nm and n are the orders of the reaction\n■\n■\nthe values of m and n can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or rarely higher\n■\n■\nwhen the value of m or n is 0 we can ignore the \nconcentration term because any number to the power of \nzero = 1.\nOrders of reaction are not always whole numbers.

We call this the reaction \nmechanism. These steps do not take place at the same \nrate. The overall rate of reaction depends on the slowest \nstep. We call this the rate-determining step. If the \nconcentration of a reactant appears in the rate equation, \nthen that reactant (or substances that react together \nto form it) appears in the rate-determining step. If a \nsubstance does not appear in the overall rate equation it \ndoes not take part in the rate-determining step. So, for \nthe reaction between propanone and iodine, H+ ions are \ninvolved in the rate-determining step but iodine is not.\nVerifying possible reaction mechanisms\nWe can use kinetic data to confirm proposed reaction \nmechanisms. It is important to realise that the mechanism is not \ndeduced from the kinetic data. The kinetic data simply show us \nthat a proposed reaction mechanism is possible.\nVarious mechanisms have been proposed for the \nreaction\nH+\nCH3COCH3  +  I2  \n  CH3COCH2I  +  HI\nFigure 22.17 shows one proposed mechanism.\nThe rate equation for this reaction is\nrate = k[CH3COCH3] [H+]\nWe could not have deduced this reaction mechanism from \nthe rate equation. But the mechanism is consistent with \nthe rate equation.\nThe slow step (the rate-determining step) does not \ninvolve either propanone or hydrogen ions directly. \nHowever, the intermediate with the formula\n+OH\n\t\nCH3   C    CH3\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nfast\nO\n+OH\nCH3   +  H+\nCH3\nC\nCH3\nC\nCH3\n+OH\nOH\nslow\nC\n⎯⎯→\nC\n+ H +\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nCH2\n+ I2\nC\nfast\nOH\n+OH\nC\nCH2I + I–\n⎯⎯→\nCH3\nCH3\nCH2\n+OH\nCH3\nfast\nO\nCH2I  +  I–\nC\nCH2I   +   HI\nC\nCH3\nFigure 22.17  Propanone molecules rapidly accept hydrogen \nions to form an intermediate that slowly forms propen-2-ol. \nThis reacts rapidly with iodine to give the products.\nis derived from substances that react together to form it \n(propanone and hydrogen ions).

The subsequent reactions are very much faster by comparison, and do not influence the overall rate.  \nTry to match the reaction steps with the illustrations to get a picture of what is happening.\n\nChapter 22: Reaction kinetics\nCH3C(OH)   CH2 is fast and iodine molecules are \nnot involved in the mechanism until after the rate-\ndetermining step. So the rate of reaction does not depend \non the concentration of iodine.\nOn page 337 we saw that the rate equation for the reaction\n2N2O5(g)  \n  4NO2(g)  +  O2\nis rate = k[N2O5]. Figure 22.18 shows a suggested \nmechanism for this reaction. The rate equation \nsuggests that a single N2O5 molecule is involved in the \nrate-determining step. This fits in with the proposed \nmechanism that suggests that the decomposition of N2O5 \nto form NO2 and NO3 is the slow step. The steps that follow \nthe slow step are relatively fast and so have no effect on \nreaction rate.\nIf there is only a single species (atom, ion or molecule) \nin the rate-determining step we call the reaction \nunimolecular. If two species (which can be the same or \ndifferent) are involved in the rate-determining step, we say \nthat the reaction is bimolecular. Mechanisms that involve \na trimolecular step are rare. This is because it is unlikely \nthat three species will collide at the same time.\n339\nfast\n2\nfast\n+\n3\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n14\t An acidified solution of hydrogen peroxide reacts with \niodide ions.\nH2O2(aq)  +  2H+(aq)  +  2I–(aq)  \n  2H2O(l)  +  I2(aq)\nThe rate equation for this reaction is\nrate = [H2O2] [I–]\n\u0007The mechanism below has been proposed for this \nreaction.\nslow\n\t\nH2O2  +  I–  \n  H2O  +  IO–\nfast\n\t\nH+  +  IO–  \n  HIO\nfast\n\t\nHIO  +  H+  +  I–  \n  I2  +  H2O\nExplain why this mechanism is consistent with the rate \nequation.\nPredicting the order of a reaction from \nreaction mechanisms\nWe can predict the order of reaction from a given reaction \nmechanism if we know the intermediates present in the \nrate-determining step (or substances that react together to \nform the intermediate).

For \nexample, small amounts of iodide ions catalyse the \ndecomposition of hydrogen peroxide. In the catalysed \nreaction, iodide ions, I–, are first oxidised to iodate(I) ions, \nIO–.

From experimental results, he suggested a \nrelationship between entropy change (∆S), the energy transferred \nreversibly from the surroundings (q) and the temperature (T):\nΔS =  q \n__ T \nFigure 23.1 Potassium reacts spontaneously \nwith water.\nIntroducing entropy\nEntropy is a measure of the dispersal of energy at a specifi c \ntemperature. Entropy can also be thought of as a measure \nof the randomness or disorder of a system. Th e higher \nthe randomness or disorder, the greater the entropy of \nthe system. A system is the part under investigation. In \nchemistry this is the chemical reaction itself, i.e. reactants \nbeing converted to products. Th e system of magnesium \nreacting with sulfuric acid in a test tube to form magnesium \nsulfate and hydrogen releases energy to the surroundings. \nTh e surroundings include:\n350\n■\n■\nthe solvent (in this case water)\n■\n■\nthe air around the test tube\n■\n■\nthe test tube itself\n■\n■\nanything dipping into the test tube (e.g. a thermometer).\nChanges that tend to continue to happen naturally are \ncalled spontaneous changes. Once started, a spontaneous \nchange will carry on. When a light is applied, methane \ngas reacts with oxygen in a spontaneous reaction to form \ncarbon dioxide and water. Th e reaction is spontaneous \nbecause the methane continues to burn in the oxygen until\nAr atom\nbefore mixing\nHe atom\nincrease in entropy\nFigure 23.2 The spontaneous mixing of helium atoms (\n\neither the methane or oxygen is completely used up. For \na reaction to be spontaneous, it does not need to happen \nrapidly. Many spontaneous reactions are slow or need an \ninput of energy to start them.\nEntropy can also be thought of as a dispersal of energy, \neither from the system to the surroundings or from \nthe surroundings to the system. Th e system becomes \nenergetically more stable when it becomes more disordered.\nChance and spontaneous change\nDiff usion\nIf you spill a few drops of perfume in a closed room with \nno air draughts, the smell spreads gradually throughout \nthe room. Th e molecules in the perfume vapour, which \nare responsible for the smell, move randomly in straight \nlines until they collide with air molecules, other perfume \nmolecules or with the walls of the room. Aft er collision, \nthe perfume molecules change direction. Th is process of \nrandom movement and random collisions of molecules is \ncalled diff usion. Th e reason molecules in a vapour diff use \nis because of the laws of chance and probability.\nafter mixing\n) with argon atoms (\n).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nWe can make a model to show how, during a \nspontaneous process, the entropy of the system increases. \nFigure 23.2 shows a system of two flasks connected by \na stopcock. One flask contains helium and the other \ncontains argon. These gases do not react.\nWhen the stopcock is opened, the gas atoms move \nspontaneously by diffusion. After mixing, the gases are \nmixed up and there is more disorder than before mixing. \nThe entropy has increased.\nDiffusion and number of ways\nWe can show that the molecules in a vapour diffuse by \nchance by thinking about the probability of finding them \nat one place at any one time. Consider the simplified \nmodel shown below.\npartition\n1\n3\n2\ngas jar B\ngas jar A\nThe three molecules in gas jar A cannot move into gas  \njar B.\nIn this model we assume that:\n■\n■\nthere are only a few molecules in gas jar A\n■\n■\nthere are no other particles present\n■\n■\nthe molecules move randomly and change directions \nwhen they collide.\nAfter we remove the partition, the molecules can move \nrandomly not only within gas jar A but also into gas jar \nB. There are three molecules and two places in which they \ncan be (gas jar A and gas jar B). The number of ways of \narranging the molecules after removing the partition is \nshown in Figure 23.3.\n2\n1\n2\n1\n3\n3\n2\n2\n1\n1\n3\n3\n3\n1\n2\n2\n3\n1\n3\n2\n1\n3\n1\n2\nFigure 23.3  The eight possible arrangements of molecules \nafter removing the partition between the gas jars.\n\nChapter 23: Entropy and Gibbs free energy\nThere are eight different ways of arranging the three \nmolecules between two gas jars. We can express this as:\nnumber of molecules\n2 × 2 × 2 = 23 = 8\ntwo gas jars\nEach of these ways is equally likely (probable). So the \nchance that all the molecules will stay in gas jar A is 1 in \n8. Similarly, the chance that all three molecules will move \nover to gas jar B is 1 in 8. The molecules diffuse because \nthere are more ways of them being spread out than \nremaining in the same place.\nIf we started with five molecules in gas jar A, the \nnumber of ways of arranging the molecules is 25 = 32 \ndifferent ways. If we scaled this up to the numbers of \ngas molecules that we might find in a container in the \nlaboratory, the number of ways of arranging the  \nmolecules is extremely large; for example, for a million \nmolecules between two gas jars it would be 21 000 000, a \nnumber that is too large for your calculator to deal with. \nSo diffusion happens because there is an overwhelming \nlikelihood of it taking place as a result of the large number \nof ways of arranging the molecules. The idea of the \n‘number of ways’ of arranging either molecules or the \nenergy within molecules dictates whether the changes \nthat take place are the ones that are most likely to happen. \nThis applies to chemical reactions as well as to physical \nprocesses such as diffusion.\n351\nQuestion\n1\t a\t \u0007For this question refer back to Figure 23.3.

Standard \nmolar entropy is the entropy of one mole of substance in \nits standard state. The symbol \nO\n— indicates that the entropy \nis at standard conditions.\nTable 23.1 shows some values for some standard  \nmolar entropies.\nSubstance\nS O\n—\n     / \n J K–1  mol–1\nSubstance\nS O\n—\n     /  \nJ K–1 mol–1\ndiamond (s)\n  2.4\nmethanol (l)\n239.7\ngraphite (s)\n  5.7\nwater (l)\n 69.9\ncalcium (s)\n 41.4\ncarbon \nmonoxide (g)\n197.6\nlead (s)\n 64.8\nhydrogen (g)\n130.6\n352\ncalcium oxide (s)\n 39.7\nhelium (g)\n126.0\ncalcium \ncarbonate (s)\n 92.9\nammonia (g)\n192.3\nmercury (l)\n 76.0\noxygen (g)\n205.0\nbromine (l)\n151.6\ncarbon \ndioxide (g)\n213.6\nTable 23.1  Standard molar entropy values of some solids, \nliquids and gases. The states are shown as state symbols after \neach substance.\nThe values of all standard molar entropies are positive. \nRemember that elements have positive standard molar \nentropy values. Do not get this muddled with the case of \nenthalpies, where the elements in their standard states \nhave entropy values of zero. The entropy values are \ncompared to a theoretically perfect crystal. The Third Law \nof Thermodynamics states that ‘All perfect crystals have \nthe same entropy at a temperature of absolute zero’. The \nnearest we can get to this is a perfect diamond weighing \n12 g cooled to as low a temperature as possible.\nFrom the values in the table and other data we can \nmake some generalisations:\n■\n■\nGases generally have much higher entropy values than \nliquids, and liquids have higher entropy values than \nsolids. There are exceptions to this. For example, calcium\n\nFigure 23.4  A diamond has a very low entropy value because \nit is a solid element with atoms regularly arranged. Bromine \nhas a high entropy value because it tends to spread out.\ncarbonate (solid) has a higher entropy value than mercury \n(liquid).\n■\n■\nSimpler substances with fewer atoms have lower  \nentropy values than more complex substances with a \ngreater number of atoms. For example, for calcium oxide, \nCaO, S O\n—\n     = 39.7 J K–1 mol–1 but for calcium carbonate, \nCaCO3, S O\n—\n     = 92.9 J K–1 mol–1. Carbon monoxide, CO, has a \nlower entropy value than carbon dioxide, CO2.\n■\n■\nFor similar types of substances, harder substances have \na lower entropy value. For example, diamond has a lower \nentropy value than graphite and calcium has a lower \nentropy value than lead.\n■\n■\nFor a given substance the entropy increases as a solid \nmelts and then changes to a vapour (see Figure 23.5). For \nexample, the molar entropy of ice just below its melting \npoint is 48.0 J K–1 mol–1; the molar entropy for water \nis 69.9 J K–1 mol–1, but just above its boiling point, the \nvalue increases to 188.7 J K–1 mol–1. There is a gradual \nincrease in entropy as the temperature of a substance is \nincreased. Increasing the temperature of a solid makes \nthe molecules, atoms or ions vibrate more. Increasing \nthe temperature of a liquid or gas increases the entropy \nbecause it increases the disorder of the particles. When \na substance melts or vaporises, there is a large increase \nin entropy because there is a very large increase in the \ndisorder of the particles.\nWhen a solid changes to a liquid:\n■\n■\nthe regularly arranged lattice of particles close together in \nthe solid changes to\n■\n■\nan irregular arrangement of particles, which are close \ntogether but rotate and slide over each other in the liquid.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nEntropy / J K–1\nboiling point\nmelting point\nTemperature / K\nFigure 23.5  The change in entropy as a substance melts and \nthen boils.\nWhen a liquid changes to a vapour:\n■\n■\nthe irregular arrangement of particles in the liquid which \nare close together and rotating changes to\n■\n■\nan irregular arrangement of particles, which are free to \nmove around rapidly because they are far apart from  \neach other.\nQuestion\n2\t Explain the difference in the entropy of each of the \nfollowing pairs of substances in terms of their state \nand structure.\na\t \u0007Br2(l) S O\n—\n     = 151.6 J K–1 mol–1\nand I2(s) S O\n—\n     = 116.8 J K–1 mol–1\nb\t \u0007H2(g) S O\n—\n     = 130.6 J K–1 mol–1\nand CH4(g) S O\n—\n     = 186.2 J K–1 mol–1\nc\t\n\u0007Hg(l) S O\n—\n     = 76.00 J K–1 mol–1\nand Na(s) S O\n—\n     = 51.20 J K–1 mol–1\nd\t \u0007SO2(g) S O\n—\n     = 248.1 J K–1 mol–1\nand SO3(l) S O\n—\n     = 95.60 J K–1 mol–1\nEntropy changes in reactions\nIn a chemical reaction, if we compare the entropies of \nthe reactants and products, we can try to explain the \nmagnitude of the entropy change and whether or not it \nincreases or decreases. We will assume that gases have \nhigh entropy and solids have low entropy. If there is a \nchange in the number of gaseous molecules in a reaction, \nthere is likely to be a significant entropy change. This is\n\nChapter 23: Entropy and Gibbs free energy\nbecause high values of entropy are associated with gases. \nThe more gas molecules, there are, the greater is the \nnumber of ways of arranging them and the higher the \nentropy. For example in the reaction:\nCaCO3(s)   \n   CaO(s)  +  CO2(g)\nthere is an increase in entropy of the system because the \na gas is being produced (high entropy) but the reactant, \ncalcium carbonate, is a solid (low entropy).\nIn the reaction\n2N2O5(g)  \n  4NO2(g)  +  O2(g)\nwe should expect an increase of entropy of the system \nbecause there are a greater number of moles of gas \nmolecules in the products (5 molecules) than in the \nreactants (2 molecules). In addition, there are two  \ndifferent product molecules but only one type of reactant  \nmolecule. This also contributes to a greater disorder in \nthe products compared with the reactants. The system \nbecomes energetically more stable when it becomes  \nmore disordered. \nIn the reaction\nN2(g)  +  3H2(g)  \n  2NH3(g)\n353\nwe should expect a decrease in the entropy of the \nsystem because there is a reduction in the number of gas \nmolecules as the reaction proceeds. So the entropy change \nof the system is negative. The reactants, hydrogen and \nnitrogen, are more stable than the product, ammonia.\nQuestion\n3\t For each of the following reactions, suggest whether \nthe entropy of the reactants or the products will be \ngreater or whether it is difficult to decide.

The \nsurroundings are so large that when energy exchange \ntakes place there is such a small change in temperature or \npressure that we can ignore these.\n■\n■\nFor an exothermic reaction, the energy released to the \nsurroundings increases the number of ways of arranging the \nenergy. This is because the energy goes into rotation and \ntranslation (movement from place to place) of molecules \nin the surroundings. So there is likely to be an increase in \nentropy and an increased probability of the chemical change \noccurring spontaneously.\n■\n■\nFor an endothermic reaction, the energy absorbed \nfrom the surroundings decreases the number of ways of \narranging the energy. So there is likely to be a decrease \nin entropy and a decreased probability of the chemical \nchange occurring spontaneously.\nTotal entropy change\nWe can use entropy values to predict whether a chemical \nreaction will occur spontaneously or not. When a \nchemical reaction takes place there is a change in entropy \nbecause the reactants and products have different entropy \nvalues. The symbol for standard entropy change is ΔS \nO\n—\n   . \nThe total entropy change involves both the system and the \nsurroundings. For the system (reactants and products) we \nwrite the entropy change as ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem.\n354\nFor the surroundings we write the entropy change as \nΔS \nO\n—\nsurroundings.\nThe total entropy change is given by:\nΔS \nO\n—\ntotal = ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem  +  ΔS \nO\n—\nsurroundings\nIf the total entropy change increases, the entropy  \nchange is positive, e.g. ΔS \nO\n—\ntotal is +40 J K–1 mol–1 . The \nreaction will then occur spontaneously. We say that the \nreaction is feasible.\nIf the total entropy change decreases, the entropy \nchange is negative, e.g. ΔS \nO\n—\ntotal is –40 J K–1 mol–1. The \nreaction is then not likely to occur.\nCalculating the entropy change of the \nsystem\nIn order to calculate the entropy change of the system we \nuse the relationship:\nΔS \nO\n—\nsystem = S \nO\n—\nproducts – S \nO\n—\nreactants\n\nNote that:\n1\t We need to take account of the stoichiometry of the \nequation (as we did in calculations involving ΔH \nO\n—\n   ).\n2\t When looking up entropy values in tables of data, we \nneed to choose the data for the correct state, solid, \nliquid or gas.\nworked examples\n1\t Calculate the entropy change of the system for  \nthe reaction:\n2Ca(s)  +  O2(g)  \n  2CaO(s)\nThe standard entropy values are:\nS O\n—\n     [Ca(s)]\t\n= 41.40 J K–1 mol–1\nS O\n—\n     [O2(g)]\t\n= 205.0 J K–1 mol–1\nS O\n—\n     [CaO(s)]\t = 39.70 J K–1 mol–1\nΔS O\n—\nsystem = S O\n—\nproducts– S O\n—\nreactants\n= 2 × S O\n—\n     [CaO(s)] – {2 × S O\n—\n     [Ca(s)]  +  S O\n—\n     [O2(g)]}\n= 2 × 39.70 – {(2 × 41.40)  +  205.0}\n= 79.40 – 287.8\nΔS O\n—\nsystem = –208.4 J K–1 mol–1\nThe negative value for the entropy change  \nshows that the entropy of the system has decreased. \nWe know, however, that calcium reacts \nspontaneously with oxygen.

If we carry out reactions at temperatures below \nstandard temperature, a decrease in temperature makes \nthe entropy change of the surroundings more negative or \nless positive. In both these cases we make the assumption \nthat ΔH \nO\n—\nreaction does not change significantly with \ntemperature. In reality ΔH \nO\n—\nreaction does change slightly with \ntemperature, but we can often disregard this change.\nWe can see how increasing the temperature affects \nthe ability of zinc carbonate to undergo thermal \ndecomposition by comparing the entropy changes at 298 K \nand 550 K. However, we have to take into account both \nthe surroundings and the system. We assume that neither \nthe standard molar entropies nor the enthalpy change of \nformation change with temperature.\nZnCO3(s)  \n  ZnO(s)  +  CO2(g)\nΔH \nO\n—\nreaction = +72.3 kJ mol–1\nFor this reaction S \nO\n—\nsystem = +174.8 J K–1 mol–1 (the same for \nboth temperatures).\nReaction at 298 K\nΔS \nO\n—\nsurroundings\t\n= ​ – 72 300 \n_______ \n298  ​\n= –242.6 J K–1 mol–1\nΔS \nO\n—\ntotal \t\n= +174.8 – 242.6 J K–1 mol–1\nΔS \nO\n—\ntotal \t\n= –67.8 J K–1 mol–1\nReaction at 550 K\nΔS \nO\n—\nsurroundings \t = ​ – 72 300 \n_______ \n550  ​\n= –131.5 J K–1 mol–1\n\nChapter 23: Entropy and Gibbs free energy\nΔS \nO\n—\ntotal \t\n= +174.8 – 131.5 J K–1 mol–1\nΔS \nO\n—\ntotal \t\n= +43.3 J K–1 mol–1\nYou can see that at 298 K the total entropy change \nis negative, so the reaction does not occur at this \ntemperature.

But the \nlarge negative value of the enthalpy change more than \ncompensates for the negative entropy change of the system \nbecause it causes the term –ΔH \nO\n—\nreaction/T to have a high \npositive value. So the total entropy change is positive \nand the reaction, once started, is spontaneous. In highly\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nexothermic reactions, where the value of ΔH \nO\n—\nreaction is large \nand negative, the enthalpy change is the driving force of \nthe reaction.\nIn endothermic reactions, the entropy term tends to \nbe more important. The term –ΔH \nO\n—\nreaction/T has a negative \nvalue. If the value of ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem and ΔS \nO\n—\nsurroundings are both \nnegative, then the reaction will not be spontaneous. \nHowever, if the value of ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem is positive and large \nenough, it can compensate for the negative value of the  \nΔS \nO\n—\nsurroundings so that ΔS \nO\n—\ntotal becomes positive. The reaction \nis spontaneous.\nChemists are usually interested in the system of \nreactants and products rather than having to consider the \nenergy changes with the surroundings. Fortunately for \nus, there is a way in which we can take account of both \nsystem and surroundings in a more straightforward way. \nThis involves a quantity called Gibbs free energy or, more \nsimply, free energy. It can also be called Gibbs energy or \nGibbs function, G.\n358\nFigure 23.7  Gibbs free energy is named after American \nscientist Josiah Willard Gibbs, who applied the concept of \nentropy and ‘applied energy’ changes to chemical reactions \nand physical processes.\nGibbs free energy\nWhat is Gibbs free energy?\nIn determining whether a chemical reaction is likely to  \nbe spontaneous we use the quantity Gibbs free energy \nchange, ΔG. The Gibbs free energy change is given by  \nthe relationship:\nΔG = –TΔStotal\n\nWe can also write the expression without having to \nconsider the entropy changes of the surroundings:\nΔG = ΔHreaction – TΔSsystem\nWhere T is the temperature in kelvin.\nGibbs free energy is a useful concept because it includes \nboth enthalpy change and entropy change.\nTo make any comparison of Gibbs free energy values \nfair, we must use standard conditions. These standard \nconditions are the same as those used for ΔH and ΔS:\n■\n■\npressure of 105 Pa\n■\n■\ntemperature of 298 K (25 °C)\n■\n■\neach substance involved in the reaction is in its normal \nphysical state (solid, liquid or gas) at 105 Pa and 298 K.\nThe standard molar Gibbs free energy of formation is  \nthe free energy change that accompanies the formation \nof one mole of a compound from its elements in their \nstandard state.\nThe symbol for standard molar Gibbs free energy of \nformation is ΔG \nO\n—\nf . The units are kJ mol–1.\nFor example:\nMg(s)  +  ​ 1 _ \n2 ​ O2(g)  \n  MgO(s)\b\nΔG \nO\n—\nf  = –569.4 kJ mol–1\nDerivation\nGibbs free energy can easily be derived from the equation \nrelating total entropy to the entropy changes of system and \nsurroundings.\nAs:\nΔS \nO\n—\ntotal = ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem – ​ ΔH \nO\n—\n    \n_____ \nT  ​\nMultiplying by –T: –TΔS \nO\n—\ntotal  = –TΔS \nO\n—\nsystem  +  ΔH \nO\n—\n   \nThe term –TΔS \nO\n—\nsystem  +  ΔH \nO\n—\n    is equivalent to the Gibbs \nfree energy change of the reaction system ΔG \nO\n—\n   .\nSo –TΔS \nO\n—\ntotal = ΔG \nO\n—\n    and so ΔG \nO\n—\n    = ΔH \nO\n—\n    – TΔS \nO\n—\nsystem.\nGibbs free energy and spontaneous \nreactions\nFor a reaction to be spontaneous, ΔS \nO\n—\ntotal  must be \npositive. The value of T is always positive on the absolute \n(kelvin) temperature scale. So applying these signs to \nthe relationship ΔG \nO\n—\n    = –TΔS \nO\n—\ntotal, the value of ΔG must \nbe negative for a reaction to be spontaneous. So, when a \nspontaneous reaction occurs at constant temperature and \npressure, the Gibbs free energy decreases. If the value of \nΔG is positive, the reaction is not spontaneous.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nApplying the equation \nΔG O\n—  = ΔH O\n— – TΔS O\n— system\nWe can calculate the Gibbs free energy change for a \nreaction if we know:\n■\n■\nthe entropy change of the system in J K–1 mol–1\n■\n■\nthe enthalpy change of the system in J mol–1; we have to \nmultiply the value of the enthalpy change by 1000 because \nthe entropy change is in joules per kelvin per mol\n■\n■\nthe temperature; under standard conditions, this is 298 K.\nworked example\n7\t Calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the \ndecomposition of zinc carbonate at 298 K.\nZnCO3(s)  \n  ZnO(s)  +  CO2(g)\b ΔH O\n—\nr    = +71.0 kJ mol–1\n(Values for S O\n—\n     in J K–1 mol–1: CO2(g) = +213.6, \nZnCO3(s) = +82.4, ZnO(s) = +43.6)\nStep 1  Convert the value of ΔH O\n—\nr   to J mol–1:\n+71.0 × 1000 = 71 000 J mol–1\nStep 2  Calculate ΔS O\n—\nsystem:\nΔS O\n—\nsystem \t= S O\n—\nproducts – S O\n—\nreactants\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t \t = S O\n—\n     [ZnO(s)]  +  S O\n—\n     [CO2(g)] – S O\n—\n     [ZnCO3(s)]\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t \t = 43.6  +  213.6 – 82.4\n\t\nΔS O\n—\nsystem \t= +174.8 J K–1 mol–1\nStep 3  Calculate ΔG O\n—\n    :\nΔG O\n—\n     \t= ΔH O\n—\nreaction – TΔS O\n—\nsystem\n\t\n\t\n\t = 71 000 – 298 × (+174.8)\nΔG O\n—\n     \t= +18 909.6 J mol–1\n= +18.9 kJ mol–1 (to 3 significant figures)\nAs the value of ΔG O\n—\n     is positive, the reaction is not \nspontaneous at 298 K.\nQuestion\n8\t Calculate the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction \nin each of the following using the standard molar \nentropy values given.

The resulting ions are often \ndifferent colours (Figure 24.2).\na\nb\nc\nd\nFigure 24.2  Vanadium and its oxidation states: a  a solution \ncontaining VO2\n+ ions; b  a solution containing VO2+ ions; c  a \nsolution containing V3+ ions; d  a solution containing V2+ ions.\n368\nTable 24.2 shows the most common oxidation states of the \nfirst row of the transition elements.\nElement\nMost common oxidation states\ntitanium (Ti)\n+3, +4\nvanadium (V)\n+2, +3, +4, +5\nchromium (Cr)\n+3, +6\nmanganese (Mn)\n+2, +4, +6, +7\niron (Fe)\n+2, +3\ncobalt (Co)\n+2, +3\nnickel (Ni)\n+2\ncopper (Cu)\n+1, +2\nTable 24.2  Common oxidation states of the transition \nelements.\nThe existence of variable oxidation states means that the \nnames of compounds containing transition elements must \nhave their oxidation number included, e.g. manganese(IV) \noxide, cobalt(II) chloride.\nWhen transition elements form ions, their atoms  \nlose electrons from the 4s subshell first, followed by  \n3d electrons.\n\nNotice the partially filled d subshells (see definition of \ntransition element on the previous page) in the following \nexamples of ions:\nV atom = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d3 4s2\nV3+ ion = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2 4s0\nFe atom = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d6 4s2\nFe3+ ion = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s0\nCu atom = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s1\nCu2+ ion = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d9 4s0\nThe most common oxidation state is +2, usually formed \nwhen the two 4s electrons are lost from the atoms. The \nmaximum oxidation number of the transition elements at \nthe start of the row involves all the 4s and 3d electrons in \nthe atoms. For example, vanadium’s maximum oxidation \nstate is +5, involving its two 4s electrons and its three \n3d electrons. At the end of the row, from iron onwards, \nthe +2 oxidation state dominates as 3d electrons become \nincreasingly harder to remove as the nuclear charge \nincreases across the period.\nQuestion\n1\t a\t \u0007State the electronic configurations of the following \natoms or ions:\ni\t\nTi\t\niv\t Fe3+\nii\t Cr\t\nv\t Ni2+\niii\t Co\t\nvi\t Cu+\nb\t \u0007Explain why scandium (which forms only one ion, \nSc3+) and zinc (which forms only one ion, Zn2+)  \nare not called transition elements.\nc\t\n\u0007Why is the maximum oxidation state of  \nmanganese +7?\nd\t \u0007Look back at the different oxidation states  \nof vanadium shown in Figure 24.2.

Common examples are the \nchromate(VI) ion, CrO4\n2–, and the manganate(VII) ion, \nMnO4\n–.\nPhysical properties of the \ntransition elements\nThe transition elements commonly have physical \nproperties that are typical of most metals:\n■\n■\nthey have high melting points\n■\n■\nthey have high densities\n■\n■\nthey are hard and rigid, and so are useful as construction \nmaterials\n■\n■\nthey are good conductors of electricity and heat.\nThe first ionisation energy, the atomic radius and the ionic \nradius of transition elements do not vary much as we go \nacross the first row.

In general, the 1st ionisation energy \nwould increase as the increasing nuclear charge has a \ntighter hold on electrons filling the same main energy level \nor shell, and the shielding effect stays roughly the same. \nFor similar reasons the atomic radius and ionic radius of \na positively charged ion would be expected to decrease\n\nChapter 24: Transition elements\nacross a period. However, the transition elements show \nonly a very small variation.\nComparing the transition elements with \nan s-block element\nThe s-block metal that lies immediately before the first row \nof d-block elements in the Periodic Table is calcium (Ca), \nin Group 2. When we compare the properties of calcium \nwith the first row of transition elements we find some \ndifferences despite the fact that they are all metals. You \nneed to know the following comparisons:\n■\n■\nthe melting point of calcium (839 °C) is lower than that of a \ntransition element (e.g. titanium at 1660 °C)\n■\n■\nthe density of calcium (1.55g cm–3) is lower than that of a \ntransition element (e.g. nickel at 8.90 g cm–3)\n■\n■\nthe atomic radius of calcium (0.197 nm) is larger than that of \na transition element (e.g. iron at 0.116 nm)\n■\n■\nthe ionic radius of the calcium ion, Ca2+, (0.099 nm) is larger \nthan that of a transition element (e.g. Mn2+ at 0.080 nm)\n■\n■\nthe first ionisation energy of calcium (590 kJ mol–1) is \nlower than that of a transition element (e.g. chromium at \n653 kJ mol–1 or cobalt at 757 kJ mol–1)\n■\n■\nthe electrical conductivity of calcium is higher than that of a \ntransition element (with the exception of copper).\n369\nQuestion\n2\t a\t \u0007Explain why the 1st ionisation energy of calcium is \nlower than that of cobalt.\nb\t \u0007Explain why the density of calcium is lower than \nthe density of nickel.\nRedox reactions\nWe have seen how the transition elements can exist in \nvarious oxidation states. When a compound of a transition \nelement is treated with a suitable reagent, the oxidation \nstate of the transition element can change. Whenever a \nreaction involves reactants changing their oxidation states \nthe reaction is a redox reaction, involving the transfer \nof electrons. Remember that a species is reduced when \nits oxidation state is reduced (gets lower in value). Its \noxidation state is lowered when it gains electrons, and, as \nwell as being reduced, it is acting as an oxidising agent. For \nexample, in the half-equation:\nFe3+(aq)  +  e–   \n   Fe2+(aq)\n\tpale yellow\t\npale green\nFe3+ has been reduced to Fe2+ by gaining one electron. In the \nequation as shown Fe3+ is acting as an oxidising agent. For this\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nreaction to happen another half-equation is needed in which \nthe reactant loses one or more electrons, i.e. acts as a reducing \nagent. In Chapter 20 (page 286) we saw how we can use \nstandard electrode potential values, E \nO\n—\n   , to predict whether or \nnot such reactions should take place.\nAnother half-equation we could consider would be:\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–   \n   Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\n\t\npurple\t\npale pink\nBoth half-equations are written below as they appear in \ntables of data showing standard electrode potentials:\nFe3+(aq)  +  e–   \n   Fe2+(aq) \b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.77 V\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–   \n  Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.52 V\nCan Fe3+ ions oxidise Mn2+ to MnO4\n– ions, or can MnO4\n– \nions in acid solution oxidise Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions?\nThe magnitude of the positive values provides a \nmeasure of the tendency of the half-equations to  \nproceed to the right-hand side. The values show us that \nMnO4\n–(aq) is more likely to accept electrons and proceed \nin the forward direction, changing to Mn2+(aq), than \nFe3+(aq) is to accept electrons and change to Fe2+(aq). \nMnO4\n–(aq) is a more powerful oxidising agent than \nFe3+(aq). Therefore MnO4\n–(aq) ions are capable of \noxidising Fe2+(aq) ions to form Fe3+(aq), and the top  \nhalf-equation proceeds in the reverse direction.\nWe can now combine the two half-cells to get the \noverall reaction. Note that the sign of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) \nhalf-cell has changed by reversing its direction. the  \nFe2+/Fe3+ equation also has to be multiplied by 5 so that \nthe electrons on either side of the equation cancel out (this \ndoes not affect the value of E \nO\n—\n   ).\n370\n5Fe2+(aq)  \n  5Fe3+(aq)  +  5e–\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = –0.77 V\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–  \n  Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.52 V\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  5Fe2+(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  \n  \nMn2+(aq)  +  5Fe3+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.75 V\nThe relatively large positive value of E \nO\n—\n    (+0.75 V) tells \nus that the reaction is likely to proceed in the forward \ndirection as written. In fact we use this reaction to \ncalculate the amount of iron (Fe2+ ions) in a sample, such \nas an iron tablet, by carrying out a titration.\n\n■\n■\nA known volume (e.g. 25 cm3) of an unknown concentration \nof Fe2+(aq) is placed in a conical flask.\n■\n■\nA solution of a known concentration of potassium \nmanganate(VII) is put in a burette.\n■\n■\nThe potassium manganate(VII) solution is titrated against the \nsolution containing Fe2+(aq) in the conical flask.\n■\n■\nThe purple colour of the manganate(VII) ions is removed in \nthe reaction with Fe2+(aq). The end-point is reached when \nthe Fe2+(aq) ions have all reacted and the first permanent \npurple colour appears in the conical flask.\nFigure 24.3  Manganate(VII) ions can be used to determine \nthe percentage of Fe2+ in an iron tablet.\nYou can achieve a more accurate result for the mass of Fe2+ \nin a solution by using dichromate(VI) ions, Cr2O7\n2–(aq), \nto oxidise it in a titration. This is because compounds such \nas potassium dichromate(VI) can be prepared to a higher \ndegree of purity than potassium manganate(VII). In a \ntitration with Fe2+(aq) and dichromate(VI) we need an \nindicator of the end-point that will be oxidised as soon as \nthe Fe2+(aq) has all reacted.\nThe half-equation and value for E \nO\n—\n    for the use of \ndichromate as an oxidising agent is:\nCr2O7\n2–(aq) + 14H+(aq) + 6e–  \n  2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.33 V\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nworked example\n1\t 0.420 g of iron ore were dissolved in acid, so that all of \nthe iron present in the original ore was then present \nas Fe2+(aq).

Different \nligands form complexes with different stabilities. For \nexample when we add concentrated aqueous ammonia to \nan aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate, the ammonia \nligands displace water ligands in a stepwise process.\n[Cu(H2O)6]2+ (aq)  +  NH3(aq)\n[Cu(NH3)(H2O)5]2+(aq)  +  H2O(l)\n[Cu(NH3)(H2O)5]2+(aq)  +  NH3(aq)\n[Cu(NH3)2(H2O)4]2+(aq)  +  H2O(l)\nAs we increase the concentration of ammonia, this \nprocess continues until four of the water molecules are \nreplaced by ammonia to form a deep blue solution. The \noverall process is:\n[Cu(H2O)6]2+  +  4NH3(aq)\n[Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nWe can think of this exchange of ligands in terms of \ncompeting equilibria of the forward and backward \nreactions. The position of equilibrium lies in the direction \nof the more stable complex. In this case, the complex with \nammonia as a ligand is more stable than the complex with \njust water as a ligand. If we dilute the complex with water, \nthe position of equilibrium shifts to the left and a complex \nwith more water molecules as ligands is formed.\nThe stability of the complex is expressed in terms of \nthe equilibrium constants for ligand displacement. This is \ncalled the stability constant. Usually an overall stability \nconstant, Kstab, is given rather than the stepwise constants. \nThe stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the \nformation of the complex ion in a solvent from its constituent \nions or molecules. The method for writing equilibrium \nexpressions for stability constants is similar to the one we \nused for writing Kc (see page 304). So for the equilibrium\n375\n[Cu(H2O)6]2+  +  4Cl–(aq)  \n  [CuCl4]2–(aq)  +  6H2O(l)\nthe expression is:\nKstab = ​ \n[[CuCl4]2–(aq)] \n \n_____________________ \n \n[[Cu(H2O)6]2+] [Cl–(aq)]4 ​\nNote:\n■\n■\nwater does not appear in the equilibrium expression \nbecause it is in such a large excess that its concentration is \nregarded as being constant\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\n■\n■\nthe units for the stability constant are worked out in the \nsame way as for the units of Kc (see page 124). For example, \nin the above case:\nKstab\t= ​ \n[[CuCl4]2–(aq)] \n \n_____________________ \n \n[[Cu(H2O)6]2+] [Cl–(aq)]4 ​  ​ \n(mol dm–3) \n \n_____________________ \n \n(mol dm–3) × (mol dm–3)4 ​\n= dm12 mol–4\nStability constants are often given on a log10 scale. When \nexpressed on a log10 scale, they have no units. Stability \nconstants can be used to compare the stability of any two \nligands. The values quoted usually give the stability of the \ncomplex relative to the aqueous ion where the ligand is \nwater. The higher the value of the stability constant, the \nmore stable the complex. Table 24.5 gives some values \nof stability constants for various copper(II) complexes \nrelative to their aqueous ions.\nLigand\nlog10 Kstab\nchloride, Cl–\n 5.6\nammonia, NH3\n13.1\n2-hydroxybenzoate\nCO2–\n16.9\n376\nOH\n25.0\n1,2-dihydroxybenzene\nOH\nOH\nTable 24.5  The stability constants of some complexes  \nof copper.\nFrom the table you can see that, in general, complexes \nwith bidentate ions (2-hydroxybenzoate and \n1,2-dihydroxybenzene) have higher stability constants than  \nthose with monodentate ligands. We can use the values of \nthe stability constants to predict the effect of adding different \nligands to complex ions. For example, the addition of excess  \nammonia to the complex [CuCl4]2–(aq) should result in the  \nformation of a dark blue solution of the ammonia complex  \nbecause the stability constant of the ammonia complex is  \nhigher than that of the chloride complex. The position of  \nequilibrium is shifted to the right in the direction of the more \nstable complex. Addition of excess 1,2-dihydroxybenzene \nto the dark blue ammonia complex results in the formation \nof a green complex with 1,2-dihydroxybenzene.

Would you expect to observe \nany changes? Explain your answer.\nThe colour of complexes\nYou cannot fail to notice the striking colours of complexes \ncontaining transition metal ions. But how do these colours \narise? White light is made up of all the colours of the \nvisible spectrum. When a solution containing a transition \nmetal ion in a complex appears coloured, part of the \nvisible spectrum is absorbed by the solution. However, that \nstill doesn’t explain why part of the spectrum is absorbed \nby transition metal ions. To answer this question we must \nlook in more detail at the d orbitals in the ions.\nThe five d orbitals in an isolated transition metal atom \nor ion are described as degenerate, meaning they are all at \nthe same energy level (Figure 24.13).\nIn the presence of ligands a transition metal ion is \nnot isolated. The co-ordinate bonding from the ligands \ncauses the five d orbitals in the transition metal ion to \nsplit into two sets of non-degenerate orbitals at slightly \ndifferent energy levels (Figure 24.14). In a complex with six\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nz\ny\nx\nx\ndyz\nz\ny\nx\ndx2–y2\nFigure 24.13 The degenerate d orbitals in a transition metal atom.\nligands, the ligands are arranged in an octahedral shape \naround the central metal ion. Th e lone pairs donated by \nthe ligands into the transition metal ion repel electrons in \nthe two dx2–y2 and dz2 orbitals shown in Figure 24.13 more \nthan those in the other three d orbitals. Th is is because \nthese d orbitals line up with the co-ordinate bonds in \nthe complex’s octahedral shape and so they are closer to \nthe bonding electrons in the octahedral arrangement, \nincreasing repulsion between electrons. Th erefore the \norbitals are split, with these two d orbitals at a slightly \nhigher energy level than the dyz, dxz and dxy orbitals \n(Figure 24.14).\nA Cu2+ ion has an electronic confi guration of \n[Ar] 3d9.

Th e diff erence in the energy \nbetween the non-degenerate d orbitals is labelled ΔE. ΔE is \npart of the visible spectrum of light. So, when light shines \non the solution containing the Cu(H2O)6\n2+ complex, \nan electron absorbs this amount of energy. It uses this \nenergy to jump into the higher of the two non-degenerate \nenergy levels. In copper complexes, the rest of the visible \nspectrum that passes through the solution makes it appear \nblue in colour.\nTh e exact energy diff erence (ΔE) between the non-\ndegenerate d orbitals in a transition metal ion is aff ected \nby many factors. One of these factors is the identity of the \nligands that surround the transition metal ion. As you \nhave seen, a solution containing Cu(H2O)6\n2+ is a light blue, \nwhereas a solution containing Cu(NH3)2(H2O)2\n2+ is a very\n377\nexcited electron\nabsorbs energy\n∆E\nenergy absorbed\nfrom visible spectrum\nthat corresponds \nto ∆E\nthe energy absorbed can be\nworked out by the equation:\n∆E = hν\nwhereν is the frequency\nof light absorbed and\nh is Planck’s constant\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\ndeep shade of blue. The colour change arises because the \npresence of the ammonia ligands causes the d orbitals to \nsplit by a different amount of energy. This means that the \nsize of ΔE changes and this results in a slightly different \namount of energy being absorbed by electrons jumping \nup to the higher orbitals. Therefore a different colour is \nabsorbed from visible light, so a different colour is seen.\nSummary\n■\t Each of the transition elements forms at least one \nion with a partially filled d orbital.

These compounds are now \ncalled aryl compounds. However, many \nchemicals with structures containing one or \nmore benzene rings do have strong odours.\nThe benzene ring\nThe ‘benzene ring’ is a particularly important functional \ngroup found in many organic compounds. A benzene \nring is a hexagon made of six carbon atoms bonded \ntogether in a particular way. Benzene rings are found in \nmany compounds that are commercially important – for \nexample as medicines, dyes and plastics.\nOrganic hydrocarbons containing one or more \nbenzene rings are called arenes. In general, compounds \nof benzene are known as aryl compounds or aromatic \ncompounds; an example is chlorobenzene, which is one of \nthe halogenoarenes.\nThe simplest arene is benzene itself. Its formula is \nC6H6. The early organic chemists struggled to work out \nits structure. However, around 1865 Friedrich August \nKekulé seemed to have solved the problem. He proposed \na hexagonal ring of carbon atoms, each bonded to one \nhydrogen atom. In Kekulé’s structure the hexagonal ring \ncontained three double C   C bonds (Figure 25.2).\n382\nThis is reflected in benzene’s name, which has the same \nending as the alkenes.\nH\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nalso shown as\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nFigure 25.2  Kekulé’s structure of benzene.\n\nFigure 25.1  This is a vanilla \norchid. Its seed pods contain \na substance called vanillin. \nIts molecules are based on a \nbenzene ring – as represented by \nthe hexagon with a circle inside \nin the structure shown below. \nVanillin is used to flavour foods \nsuch as ice cream and chocolate. \nIts structure is:\nOH\nO\nCH3\nO\nC\nH\nAs analytical techniques were developed, however, \nchemists found out that the benzene molecule was a \nplanar, perfectly symmetrical molecule. Kekulé’s structure \nwould suggest three shorter double C   C bonds and three \nlonger single C   C bonds in the ring. This would produce \na distorted hexagonal shape, not the perfect hexagonal \narrangement of carbon atoms in benzene’s actual \nmolecules. Figure 25.3 shows how we represent benzene’s \nskeletal formula.\nFigure 25.3  The skeletal formula of benzene. It can also be \nused in displayed formulae of aryl compounds, as on the \nprevious page showing the structure of vanillin.\nWe can now measure actual bond lengths. This was \nimpossible in the 19th century when Kekulé worked. \nTable 25.1 shows that the bond length of the carbon–\ncarbon bonds in benzene lie between the values for C   C \nsingle bonds and C   C double bonds.\nBond\nBond length / nm\nC   C\n0.154\nC   C\n0.134\ncarbon to carbon bond in benzene\n0.139\nTable 25.1  Comparing bond lengths.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nThe chemistry of benzene also suggests that the Kekulé \nstructure is incorrect. If there were three C   C bonds \nin benzene it would undergo addition reactions like the \nalkenes (see page 209). However, this is not the case. For \nexample, ethene will decolorise bromine water on mixing, \nbut benzene needs much harsher conditions.\nThe actual structure of benzene can be explained by \nconsidering the bonding in the molecule. Each carbon \natom in the hexagonal ring is sp2 hybridised (see page 57), \nsharing:\n■\n■\none pair of electrons with one of its neighbouring  \ncarbon atoms\n■\n■\none pair of electrons with its other neighbouring  \ncarbon atom\n■\n■\none pair of electrons with a hydrogen atom.\nThese are σ (sigma) bonds; covalent bonds with the pair \nof electrons found mainly between the nuclei of the atoms \nbonded to each other. Each carbon atom forms three σ \nbonds. That leaves one electron spare on each of the six \ncarbon atoms. Each carbon atom contributes this one \nelectron to a π (pi) bond (see page 57). However, the π \nbonds formed are not localised between pairs of carbon \natoms as in an alkene C   C bond (see page 193). Instead, \nthe π bonds in benzene spread over all six carbon atoms \nin the hexagonal ring. The six electrons in the π bonds are \nsaid to be delocalised.\nThe π bonding in benzene is formed by the overlap \nof carbon p atomic orbitals, one from each of the six \ncarbon atoms. To achieve maximum overlap, the benzene \nmolecule must be planar. The lobes of the p orbitals \noverlap to form a ring of delocalised electrons above \nand below the plane of the carbon atoms in the benzene \nmolecule. This is shown in Figure 25.4.\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\noverlap of p orbitals \nproduces a ring of \ndelocalised electrons \nabove and below the \nplane of benzene’s \ncarbon atoms\nFigure 25.4  The π bonding in benzene.

This occurs \nby substituting an atom, or group of atoms, for one or more \nhydrogen atoms attached to the benzene ring. The initial \nattack is usually by an electrophile, which is attracted to the \nhigh electron density around the benzene ring.\n384\nElectrophilic substitution with chlorine \nor bromine\nBenzene will react with bromine in the presence of an \nanhydrous iron(III) bromide catalyst. The catalyst can be \nmade in the reaction vessel by adding iron filings to the \nbenzene and bromine. The substitution reaction is:\nBr\nanhydrous\nFeBr3 catalyst\n+  HBr\n+  Br2\nAt first sight the electrophile that starts the attack on \nbenzene is not obvious. The electrophile is created when  \nan iron(III) bromide molecule polarises a bromine \nmolecule. The Br2 molecule forms a dative (co-ordinate) \nbond with iron(III) bromide by donating a lone pair of \nelectrons from one bromine atom into an empty 3d orbital \nin the iron. This draws electrons from the other bromine \natom in the Br2 molecule making it partially positive, \ncreating the electrophile.\n\nWe can think of the electrophile as a Br+ cation:\nBr\nBr\nFeBr3\nBr+\n  \n+ [FeBr4]–\nδ+\nδ–\nThe Br+ cation and the ‘electron-rich’ benzene ring are \nattracted to each other, as the mechanism below shows. \nRemember that the curly arrows show the movement of a \npair of electrons.\nBr\nH\nBr\nstage 1\n⎯⎯⎯→\n⎯⎯⎯→\nstage 2\n+ HBr\n[FeBr4]–\n(+FeBr3)\nBr+\n+\nA similar reaction happens when chlorine gas is bubbled \nthrough benzene at room temperature in the presence \nof a catalyst such as iron(III) chloride or aluminium \nchloride.

These positions are ‘activated’ \nby any electron-donating groups bonded directly to the \nbenzene ring (see Table 25.4 on page 390). Other  \nexamples of benzene compounds that are activated in \nthese positions are phenol and phenylamine. So when \nwe react methylbenzene with chlorine gas, using an \nanhydrous aluminium chloride catalyst, two products can \nbe made:\nCH3\nCH3\nCl\nCH3\nAlCl3\n + \n+  2HCl\n+  2Cl2\nCl\n2-chloromethyl-\n4-chloromethyl-\nbenzene\nbenzene\nIf excess chlorine gas is bubbled through, we can \nform 1-methyl-2,4-dichlorobenzene, 1-methyl-2,6-\ndichlorobenzene and 1-methyl-2,4,6-trichlorobenzene. \n(Remember that the 2 and 6 positions in substituted arenes \nare equivalent.)\nThe carbon–halogen bond in halogenoarenes is \nstronger than the equivalent bond in a halogenoalkane \nbecause one of the lone pairs on the halogen atom  \noverlaps slightly with the π bonding system in the benzene \nring. This gives the carbon–halogen bond a partial double \nbond character.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nNotice that the methyl side-chain is not affected under the \nconditions used in the reaction above. However, we learnt \non page 206 that chlorine will react with alkanes in the \npresence of ultraviolet (UV) light or strong sunlight. This \nis a free radical substitution reaction. So if the chlorine gas \nis passed into boiling methylbenzene, in the presence of \nUV light, the following reaction takes place:\nCH3\nCH2Cl\nboil\n +  HCl\n UV light\n+  Cl2\nchloromethyl-\nbenzene\nNote that there is no substitution into the benzene ring \nunder these conditions. In excess chlorine, eventually all \nthree of the hydrogen atoms on the methyl side-chain will \nbe replaced by chlorine atoms.\nQuestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write the equation for the reaction of chlorine  \nwith benzene in the presence of an iron(III) \nchloride catalyst.\n\u0007b\t \u0007What do we call this type of mechanism for the \nreaction in part a?\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Draw the mechanism of the reaction in part a, with \nCl+ as the attacking species and using curly arrows \nto show the movement of electron pairs.\n\u0007d\t \u0007Draw the displayed formula of the ‘tri-substituted’ \nhalogenoarene produced if methylbenzene is \nadded to excess bromine at room temperature in \nthe presence of iron(III) bromide.\n\u0007e\t \u0007How would the reaction in part d differ if the \nmethylbenzene and bromine were boiled in the \npresence of UV light?\n\u0007f\t\n\u0007Name the mechanism of the reaction in part e.\nNitration of benzene\nThe nitration of benzene is another example of an \nelectrophilic substitution. Nitration refers to the \nintroduction of the NO2 group into a molecule. In this \nreaction the electrophile is the NO2\n+ ion, known as the\n\nChapter 25: Benzene and its compounds\nnitronium ion (or nitryl cation). This is made from a \nmixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated \nsulfuric acid:\nHNO3  +  2H2SO4  \n  NO2\n+  +  2HSO4\n–  +  H3O+\nThis ‘nitrating mixture’ is refluxed with benzene at about \n55 °C to make nitrobenzene:\nNO2\n+  HNO3\n+  H2O\n⎯→\nThe mechanism of the electrophilic substitution is:\nNO2\nNO2\nH\n+\nstage 1\nstage 2\nNO2\n+\n+  H+\nIn stage 1 in the mechanism, the electrophile, NO2\n+, is \nattracted to the high electron density of the π bonding \nsystem in benzene. A pair of electrons from the benzene \nring is donated to the nitrogen atom in NO2\n+, and forms \na new covalent bond. At this point, benzene’s delocalised \nring of electrons is disrupted. There are now four π \nbonding electrons and a positive charge spread over five \ncarbon atoms.\nHowever, the full delocalised ring is restored in stage 2 \nwhen the C   H bond breaks heterolytically. Both electrons in \nthe C   H covalent bond go into nitrobenzene’s π bonding \nsystem, and hydrogen leaves as an H+ ion. There are now \nsix electrons spread over the six carbon atoms, so the \nchemical stability of the benzene ring is retained in this \nsubstitution reaction.\nFurther nitration of the nitrobenzene produces \n1,3-dinitrobenzene and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene. Unlike \nthe electron-donating methyl group in methylbenzene \n(which activates the 2 and 4 positions in the benzene \nring), the NO2 group is electron-withdrawing. This type \nof group (which includes COOH) deactivates the 2 and \n4 positions in the benzene ring. Therefore, when there \nis a nitro group bonded to the benzene ring, further \nsubstitution takes place at the 3 and 5 positions (see Table \n25.4, page 390).\n385\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n4\t \u0007a\t \u0007Copy and complete the two equations below, \nwhich can be used to show the nitration of \nmethylbenzene:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007C6H5CH3  +  NO2\n+  \n  \n  +  \n\t\n H2SO4\n\t\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007C6H5CH3  +  HNO3  \n  \n  +\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007Name the possible mono-substituted products \nin parts i and ii.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iv\t \u00071-methyl-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 1-methyl-\n2,4,6-trinitrobenzene are formed on further \nnitration of methylbenzene.

Examples include \nthe manufacture of detergents or the reactants needed to \nmake plastics, such as poly(phenylethene) – commonly \nknown as polystyrene. They can use a Friedel–Crafts \nreaction to substitute a hydrogen in the benzene ring for \nan alkyl group, such as a methyl (  CH3) or an ethyl  \n(  C2H5) group:\nCH3\nCH2CH3\nethylbenzene\nmethylbenzene\n\nThe same type of reaction can also be used to introduce an \nacyl group into a benzene ring.

For example, alkanes are not usually \noxidised by a chemical oxidising agent such as potassium \nmanganate(VII). However in alkylarenes, the alkane side-\nchain is oxidised to form a carboxylic acid. For example, \nmethylbenzene produces benzoic acid when refluxed with \nalkaline potassium manganate(VII), and then acidified \nwith dilute sulfuric acid, or another strong oxidising \nagent such as acidified potassium dichromate(VI):\nCH3\nCOOH\n+\n+\n3[O]\nH2O\nquestions\n5\t \u0007a\t \u0007Copy and complete the two equations below, \nwhich can be used to show the alkylation and \nacylation of benzene, to produce the mono-\nsubstituted products.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007C6H6  +  CH3CH2CH2Cl  \n  \n  +\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007C6H6  +  CH3CH2CH2CH2COCl\n+\n\u0007b\t \u0007i\t\n\u0007Name the mono-substituted organic product \nin part a i.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007What class of compound is formed in part a ii?\n6\t \u0007Hexylbenzene is refluxed with alkaline potassium \nmanganate(VII) and then acidified with dilute sulfuric \nacid.

It is used to manufacture a wide range of products \n(Figure 25.5). Its structure is:\nOH\n387\nFigure 25.5  Araldite adhesive, compact discs and TCP® \nantiseptic (which contains 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, as  \ndoes Dettol®) are all manufactured using phenol as a  \nstarting material.\nThe melting point of phenol is relatively high for an aryl \ncompound of its molecular mass because of hydrogen \nbonding between its molecules. However, the large  \nnon-polar benzene ring makes phenol only slightly  \nsoluble in water, as it disrupts hydrogen bonding with \nwater molecules.\nPhenol is weakly acidic, losing an H+ ion from its \nhydroxyl group:\nC6H5OH(aq)  \n  C6H5O–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n\t\nphenoxide ion\nThe position of this equilibrium lies well over to the \nleft-hand side. However, phenol is still a stronger acid \nthan water or an alcohol. The values of pKa are shown in \nTable 25.3. Remember: the higher the value of pKa, the \nweaker the acid (see page 307).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nWeak acid\nDissociation in water\npKa at \n25 °C\nphenol\nC6H5OH(aq)  \n  C6H5O–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n10.0\nwater\nH2O(l)  \n  H+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\n14.0\nethanol\nC2H5OH(aq)  \n  C2H5O–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n16.0\nTable 25.3  Comparing the acidity of phenol, water  \nand ethanol.\nPhenol is more acidic than water, with ethanol being the \nleast acidic of the three compounds. We can explain this \nby looking at the conjugate bases formed on the right-hand \nside of the equations in Table 25.3. The phenoxide ion, \nC6H5O–(aq), has its negative charge spread over the whole \nion as one of the lone pairs on the oxygen atom overlaps \nwith the delocalised π bonding system in the benzene ring.\n–\nO\nO–\nCH3CH2\nethoxide ion, with\nphenoxide ion,\nwith negative\ncharge spread over\nthe whole ion\nnegative charge\nconcentrated on\n388\nthe oxygen\nThis delocalisation reduces the charge density of the \nnegative charge on the phenoxide ion compared with \nOH–(aq) or C2H5O–(aq). Therefore H+(aq) ions are not \nas strongly attracted to the phenoxide ion as they are to \nhydroxide or ethoxide ions, making phenoxide ions less \nlikely to re-form the undissociated molecules.\nAlternatively, we can explain the greater acidity of \nphenol by saying that phenol ionises to form a more  \nstable negative ion, so the ionisation of phenol is more \nlikely. This results in the position of equilibrium in the \nphenol equation in Table 25.3 lying further to the right-\nhand side (i.e. more molecules donating an H+ ion) than \nthe other equations.\nEthanol is a weaker acid than water because of the \nelectron-donating alkyl (ethyl) group attached to the \noxygen atom in the ethoxide ion. This has the effect of \nconcentrating more negative charge on this oxygen atom, \nwhich more readily accepts an H+ ion. This explains why \nthe position of equilibrium lies further to the left-hand \nside, favouring the undissociated ethanol molecules.\n\nQuestion\n7\t \u0007a\t \u0007Place the following molecules in order of their \nacidity, starting with the most acidic:\nCH3COOH   C6H5OH   HCl    C3H7OH   H2O\n\u0007b\t \u0007Would you expect methanol to be more or less \nacidic than phenol? Explain your answer.\nReactions of phenol\nWe can divide the reactions of phenol into those involving \nthe hydroxyl group, OH, and those involving substitution \ninto the benzene ring.\nBreaking of the OH bond in phenol\nAlthough phenol is only slightly soluble in water, it \ndissolves well in an alkaline solution. As you have just \nlearnt, phenol is a weak acid so it will react with an alkali \nto give a salt plus water:\n+  H2O\nOH + NaOH\nO–Na+\nThe salt formed, sodium phenoxide, is soluble in water.\nPhenol also reacts vigorously with sodium metal, giving \noff hydrogen gas and again forming sodium phenoxide:\nOH  +  2Na              2\nO–Na+  +  H2\n2\n⎯→\nSubstitution into the benzene ring  \nof phenol\nCompared with benzene, phenol reacts more readily \nwith electrophiles. The overlap of one of the lone pairs of \nelectrons on the oxygen atom in the OH group with the \nπ bonding system increases the electron density of the \nbenzene ring in phenol. This makes the benzene ring more \nopen to attack from electron-deficient electrophiles. It \n‘activates’ the benzene ring, especially at positions 2, 4  \nand 6 (see Table 25.4, page 390).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nBromination of phenol\nPhenol undergoes similar reactions to benzene, \nbut phenol does so under milder conditions. For \nexample, bromine water will not react with benzene \nat room temperature. To produce bromobenzene we \nneed pure bromine (not a solution) and an iron(III) \nbromide catalyst.\nHowever, bromine water reacts readily with phenol, \ndecolorising the orange solution and forming a white \nprecipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (see Figure 25.6):\nOH\nOH\nBr\nBr\n→\n+  3HBr\n+  3Br2\nBr\nSimilar reactions happen between phenol and chlorine  \nor iodine.\nThis activation of the benzene ring is also shown in \nthe nitration of phenol.

Other common carboxylic acids are citric acid, \nwhich gives citrus fruits their sharp taste, and ascorbic \nacid, which is the vitamin C in the same fruits.\nThe acidity of carboxylic acids\nCarboxylic acids display the typical reactions of all \nacids due to the presence of excess H+(aq) ions in their \naqueous solutions (see page 307). For example, they react \nwith bases to form a salt plus water. Their salts are called \ncarboxylates. The carboxylate salt formed by the reaction \nof ethanoic acid with sodium hydroxide is called sodium \nethanoate, CH3COO–Na+.\nThe carboxylic acids are weak acids.

The carboxylic acids \nprepared are not usually oxidised any further.\nHowever, methanoic acid (HCOOH) is a stronger \nreducing agent than other carboxylic acids, so it can \nundergo further oxidation.\nO\nH\nH\nC\nO\nFigure 26.3  The displayed formula of methanoic acid.\nThis involves the oxidising agent breaking down the \nmethanoic acid molecule, forming carbon dioxide. This \noxidation can be carried out even by warming with mild \noxidising agents (such as the Fehling’s or Tollens’ reagents \nused to distinguish between aldehydes and ketones – see \npage 239).\nIn a positive test for an aldehyde, the Cu2+ ion in \nFehling’s solution is reduced to the Cu+ ion, which \nprecipitates out as red copper(I) oxide. When methanoic \nacid is oxidised by Fehling’s solution, the same positive \ntest result is obtained. With Tollens’ reagent, the silver ion \npresent, Ag+, is reduced to silver metal when it oxidises \nmethanoic acid (also as in the positive test for  \nan aldehyde).\nThe half-equation for the oxidation of methanoic acid \ncan be written in terms of electron transfer to an oxidising \nagent as:\n395\noxidation\n\t\n        HCOOH  \n  CO2  +  2H+(aq)  +  2e–\noxidation number\t\n+2\t\n+4\nor in terms of the addition of oxygen from an oxidising \nagent as:\nHCOOH  +  [O]  \n  CO2  +  H2O\nThis oxidation of methanoic acid will also occur with \nstronger oxidising agents such as acidified solutions of \npotassium manganate(VII) – decolorising the purple \nsolution – or potassium dichromate(VI) – turning the \norange solution green.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nAnother common example of a carboxylic acid that can  \nbe oxidised by these stronger oxidising agents is \nethanedioic acid (a dicarboxylic acid).

However, the synthetic reactions that are \nneeded can be difficult to do because carboxylic acids are \nquite unreactive. One way round this is to first convert  \nthe carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Acyl chlorides are \nmuch more reactive than carboxylic acids.\nAs we saw on page 396, an acyl chloride is similar \nin structure to a carboxylic acid, with the \n OH group \nreplaced by a Cl atom. So the \n COOH functional group \nis changed to the \n COCl group. The structural formula of \nacyl chlorides can be written as ROCl, where R is an alkyl \nor aryl group. For example, propanoyl chloride can be \nwritten as CH3CH2COCl.\nThe structural formulae of benzoic acid and its \nderivative benzoyl chloride are shown in Figure 26.5.\nCl\nO\nH\nO\nO\nC\nC\nderived from\nbenzoic acid\nbenzoyl chloride\nFigure 26.5  Benzoyl chloride is the acyl chloride derived from \nbenzoic acid.\nAcyl chlorides are reactive compounds. The carbonyl \ncarbon has electrons drawn away from it by the Cl atom as \nwell as by its O atom, and both are strongly electronegative \natoms. This gives the carbonyl carbon a relatively large \npartial positive charge and makes it particularly open to \nattack from nucleophiles.\nδ–\nO\nδ+\nC\nδ–\nCl\nThe acyl chlorides are reactive liquids. When they react \nwith nucleophiles the C   Cl bond breaks and white fumes \nof hydrogen chloride, HCl, are given off. To generalise \ntheir reactions, we can write:\nROCl  +  HZ  \n  ROZ  +  HCl\nwhere HZ can be water, an alcohol, ammonia or an amine. \nNotice that HZ contains either an oxygen or nitrogen atom \nwith a lone pair of electrons that can be donated. HZ can \ntherefore act as a nucleophile.\n\nChapter 26: Carboxylic acids and their derivatives\nHydrolysis of acyl chlorides\nWater is a suitable nucleophile to attack an acyl \nchloride molecule. A lone pair on the oxygen atom \nin water initiates the attack on the δ+ carbonyl \ncarbon atom. The reaction produces a carboxylic \nacid and hydrogen chloride. It is an example of \na hydrolysis reaction, i.e. the breakdown of a \ncompound by water. For example:\nCH3CH2COCl  +  H2O  \n  CH3CH2COOH  +  HCl\npropanoyl chloride\t\npropanoic acid\nThe acyl chloride can be added to water using  \na dropping pipette. The reaction is immediate  \nand white fumes of HCl are observed rising from \nthe liquid.\nFigure 26.6 shows the mechanism of the hydrolysis, \nshowing the initial attack by a water molecule, acting as a \nnucleophile, followed by the elimination of a molecule of \nhydrogen chloride.\n397\nH\nH\nO\nH\nH\nO\n+\nH\nO\nCH3C\nCl\nO\nδ+\nCH3C\nC\nC\nCH3C\n+ HCl\nO\nCl\nO–\nFigure 26.6  The condensation (addition-elimination) \nmechanism of hydrolysis of ethanoyl chloride.\nThe hydrolysis can be classified as a condensation reaction, \nas there is an initial addition reaction of water across the  \nC   O bond, followed by elimination of a small molecule, \nin this case HCl.\nThis reaction is far more vigorous than the hydrolysis \nof chloroalkanes (see page 219). The hydrolysis of \nchloroalkanes needs a strong alkali, such as aqueous \nsodium hydroxide, to be refluxed with the chloroalkane \nto hydrolyse it. The nucleophile needed to hydrolyse a \nchloroalkane is the negatively charged hydroxide ion, OH–. \nHowever, a neutral water molecule is sufficient to hydrolyse \nan acyl chloride quickly at room temperature. This \ndifference is due to the carbon bonded to the chlorine atom \nin a chloroalkane not being as strongly δ+ as the carbon \natom in an acyl chloride. Remember, in an acyl chloride \nthe carbon bonded to the chlorine atom is also attached\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nto an oxygen atom. It has two strongly electronegative \natoms pulling electrons away from it. Therefore the attack \nby the nucleophile is much more rapid.\nAryl chlorides, such as chlorobenzene, will not \nundergo hydrolysis. The carbon atom bonded to the \nchlorine atom is part of the delocalised π bonding system \nof the benzene ring. The p orbitals from the Cl atom tend \nto overlap with the delocalised p electrons in the benzene \nring. This causes the C — Cl bond to have some double \nbond character, making it stronger, and hydrolysis does \nnot occur.\nThe ease of hydrolysis, starting with the compounds most \nreadily broken down, is:\nacyl chloride > chloroalkane > aryl chloride\nquestions\n4\t \u0007In its reaction with a nucleophile, explain why an acyl \nchloride reacts faster than an alcohol.\n5\t \u0007a\t \u0007Name the products of the hydrolysis of  \npropanoyl chloride.\n398\n\u0007b\t \u0007i\t\n\u0007Place the following compounds in order of  \nease of hydrolysis, starting with the most \nreactive first.\n\u0007C6H5Cl    \u0007CH3CH2COCl    \u0007CH3CH2CH2Cl\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007Explain your answer to part i.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007If a reaction occurs with water, what will you \nsee in part i?\nQuestion\nReaction with alcohols and phenol\nWhen acyl chlorides react with alcohols and phenol, we \nget esters (and HCl) formed.

For example, a primary amine is an \nammonia molecule with one of its H atoms replaced by an \nalkyl or aryl group. Ammonia and the amines act as bases \nbecause of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. \nRemember that a base is a proton (H+ ion) acceptor. The \nnitrogen atom donates its lone pair to an H+ ion, forming a \nco-ordinate (dative) bond.\nFor ammonia:\nNH3  +  H+  \n  NH4\n+\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nFor a primary amine:\nRNH2  +  H+  \n  RNH3\n+\nDilute hydrochloric acid reacts with ammonia and with \namines to produce salts.\nFor ammonia:\nNH3  +  HCl  \n  NH4\n+Cl–\nammonium chloride\nFor a primary amine:\nCH3NH2  +  HCl  \n  CH3NH3\n+Cl–\nmethylammonium chloride\nAmmonia and the amines have different strengths as bases.\nThe strength of ammonia and amines as bases depends \non the availability of the lone pair of electrons on their N \natom to bond with an H+ ion.\nLet us consider ammonia, ethylamine and phenylamine  \nas examples.

This is because the diazonium salt is unstable and  \nwill decompose easily, giving off nitrogen gas, N2, at \nhigher temperatures.\n403\nDiazotisation\nPhenylamine is an important compound in the \nsynthesis of dyes. The first step is the reaction \nbetween phenylamine and nitrous acid (nitric(III) \nacid), HNO2, to give a diazonium salt. Nitrous \nacid is unstable, so it has to be made in the test \ntube, then the phenylamine added. We can make \nthe nitrous acid using sodium nitrite (sodium \nnitrate(III)) and dilute hydrochloric acid:\nNaNO2  +  HCl  \n  HNO2  +  NaCl\n\t\nnitrous acid\nThe first step in the synthesis of a dye is the \nproduction of benzenediazonium chloride:\nN\nNCl– + 2H2O\n+\nNH2 + HNO2 + HCl\nbenzenediazonium\nchloride",
