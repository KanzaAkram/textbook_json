Trying to superimpose \nthe two isomers is like trying to superimpose your left hand on \ntop of your right hand – it can’t be done.\nOptical isomers differ in their effect on polarised light. \nNormal light is unpolarised. It can be thought of as \nfluctuating electric and magnetic fields, vibrating at right \nangles to each other in every possible direction. Passing \nthis unpolarised light through a polariser results in \npolarised light, which vibrates in only one plane. A pair of \noptical isomers will rotate the plane of polarised light by \nequal amounts but in opposite directions. One will rotate \npolarised light clockwise and the other anticlockwise.\nQuestion\n10\t a\t \u0007Draw the displayed formulae and name the cis–\ntrans isomers of but-2-ene.\n196\nb\t \u0007The molecule CHBrClF exhibits optical  \nisomerism. Draw the 3D displayed formulae of \nboth optical isomers.\nOrganic reactions – mechanisms\nChemists find it useful to explain organic reactions by \nsummarising the overall reaction in a series of steps  \ncalled a reaction mechanism. Like all chemical reactions, \norganic reactions involve the breaking and making of \nchemical bonds. There are two ways in which covalent \nbonds can break:\n■\n■\nhomolytic fission\n■\n■\nheterolytic fission.\nHomolytic fission\nIn this type of bond breaking, both the atoms at each end \nof the bond leave with one electron from the pair that \nformed the covalent bond. This is shown in Figure 14.22, \nusing the simple example of a hydrogen chloride molecule.\nH\nCl\nH\n+\nCl\n⎯→\nFigure 14.22  Homolytic fission of a covalent bond.\n\nThe species produced when a bond breaks homolytically \nare called free radicals. We can show the formation of free \nradicals by using an equation:\nHCl   \n   H   +  Cl\nH  and Cl  are free radicals. All free radicals have an \nunpaired electron (represented by the dot) and are  \nvery reactive.\nYou can read more about a free-radical reaction on \npage 207.\n■\n■\nThis type of reaction involves the formation of the free \nradicals in an initiation step. This requires an input  \nof energy to break a covalent bond, resulting in two  \nfree radicals.\n■\n■\nThe radicals formed can then attack reactant molecules, \ngenerating more free radicals. These reactions are called \npropagation steps. They can be thought of as a chain \nreaction, which only stops when free radicals react with \neach other.\n■\n■\nTwo free radicals reacting together will form a molecule, \nwith no free radicals generated. Therefore this is called a \ntermination step.\nHeterolytic fission\nThe second type of bond breaking involves the ‘uneven’ \nbreaking of a covalent bond. In heterolytic fission the \nmore electronegative atom takes both the electrons in the \ncovalent bond. Again we can use hydrogen chloride to \nillustrate this (Figure 14.23).\n+\n–\n⎯→\nCl\nH\nH\n+\nCl\nFigure 14.23  Heterolytic fission of a covalent bond.\nWe can show this type of bond breaking in an equation.  \nA small curly arrow shows the movement of a pair  \nof electrons:\nH \n  Cl    \n     H+  +  Cl−\nThe heterolytic fission of a bond can involve a C \n X bond, \nwhere X is an atom more electronegative than carbon.  \nFor example:\nH3C \n  Br    \n     CH3\n+  +  Br−\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nIn this case, as the bond breaks, the Br atom takes \nboth the shared electrons, forming a bromide anion (a \nnegatively charged ion). This leaves the methyl group one \nelectron short, resulting in the formation of a positively \ncharged ion. This type of alkyl ion is called a carbocation. \nThese positively charged carbocations often appear in \nreaction mechanisms (see page 221). There are three \ntypes of carbocations that you need to consider: primary, \nsecondary and tertiary carbocations (Figure 14.24).\nH\nR\nR\nR\nR\nC+\nR\nC+\nC+\nH\nH\nR\nsecondary \ncarbocation\ntertiary carbocation\n(most stable)\nprimary carbocation\n(least stable)\nKey:  where R = an alkyl group\nFigure 14.24  Note that the carbon atom with the positive \ncharge only has three covalent bonds, not the usual four, \nmaking it electron deficient. Alkyl groups have the effect of \nspreading out the charge on the carbocation. The more alkyl \ngroups adjacent to the positively charged carbon atom, the \nmore stable the carbocation.\nThe type of carbocation formed in a reaction mechanism \ncan affect the products formed in some organic reactions, \nsuch as addition reactions to alkenes (see page 208). \nAlkyl groups (e.g.  \n CH3,  \n C2H5,  \n C3H7, etc.) tend \nto ‘push’ the electrons away from themselves. We say \nthat the electron-donating nature of alkyl groups has a \npositive inductive effect on adjacent groups. Therefore, \nin carbocations the more alkyl groups attached to the \npositively charged carbon, the less the charge density is on \nthe carbon atom with the three covalent bonds. Organic \nintermediates formed in the course of a reaction are \nenergetically more stable when any charge on a species is \nnot concentrated in one place but is spread over several \natoms. So when carbocations are formed as intermediates \nin reactions, the tertiary carbocation is most likely to form \nas its positive charge is, in effect, ‘smeared’ over the C+ \natom and the three carbon atoms it is bonded to.\nCarbocations are an example of a species called  \nan electrophile.\nAn electrophile is an acceptor of a pair of electrons.\n\nChapter 14: Introduction to organic chemistry\nWhen an electrophile accepts a pair of electrons this \nresults in the formation of a new covalent bond (see \npage 209).\nYou will also meet nucleophiles when studying organic \nreactions. These are electron-rich species, i.e. they carry a \nnegative, or partial negative, charge.\nA nucleophile is a donator of a pair of electrons.\nWhen a nucleophile donates a pair of electrons, this leads \nto the formation of a new covalent bond with the electron-\ndeficient atom under attack (see page 237).\nQuestion\n11\t a\t \u0007Write an equation to show the homolytic fission of \nthe Cl \n Cl bond in a chlorine molecule, Cl2.\nb\t \u0007Write an equation to show the heterolytic fission of \nthe C \n Cl bond in chloromethane.

An example is the \naddition reaction between an alkene and bromine (see \npage 209):\nC2H4  +  Br2  \n  C2H4Br2\nElimination reactions result in the removal of a small \nmolecule from a larger one. An example is the dehydration \nof an alcohol by concentrated sulfuric acid (see page 230):\nconc. H2SO4\nC2H5OH  \n  C2H4  +  H2O\nSubstitution reactions involve the replacement of one \natom, or a group of atoms, by another. For example, the \nfree-radical substitution of alkanes by chlorine in sunlight \n(see page 207):\nUV light\nCH4  +  Cl2  \n  CH3Cl  +  HCl\nHere an H atom in CH4 has been replaced by a Cl atom.\nHydrolysis is the breakdown of a molecule by water. \nThis type of reaction is often speeded up by acid or alkali. \nFor example, the hydrolysis of a halogenoalkane by water \nto give an alcohol (see page 219):\n198\nC2H5Br  +  H2O  \n  C2H5OH  +  HBr\nHydrolysis with alkali is faster, and gives slightly  \ndifferent products:\nC2H5Br  +  NaOH  \n  C2H5OH  +  NaBr\nOxidation is defined as the loss of electrons from a species. \nHowever, in organic reactions it is often simpler to think  \nof oxidation reactions in terms of the number of oxygen  \nand/or hydrogen atoms before and after a reaction.\nOxidation is the addition of oxygen atoms to a molecule \nand/or the removal of hydrogen atoms from a molecule.\nAn example is the partial oxidation of ethanol to ethanal \nusing acidified potassium dichromate(VI) solution (see \npage 231):\nC2H5OH  +  [O]  \n  CH3CHO  +  H2O\n■\n■\nbefore the reaction ethanol contains one O atom and six  \nH atoms\n■\n■\nafter the reaction ethanal contains one O atom and four  \nH atoms.\n\nIn effect, the ethanol loses two H atoms, so we can say it \nhas been oxidised.\nNotice the use of [O] to simplify the chemical equation \nused to describe oxidation reactions. This is commonly \nused, but the equation must still be balanced – just like a \nnormal equation. For example, in the complete oxidation \nof ethanol to ethanoic acid, using the reagents above but \nunder harsher conditions (see page 231):\nC2H5OH  +  2[O]  \n  CH3COOH  +  H2O\n[O] represents an oxygen atom from the oxidising agent. \nThe 2 in front of the [O] is needed to balance the equation \nfor oxygen atoms.\nReduction is the chemical opposite of oxidation.\nFor example, in the reduction of a ketone, using \nsodium tetrahydridoborate, NaBH4 (see page 237):\nCH3COCH3  +  2[H]  \n  CH3CHOHCH3\nNotice the use of [H] to simplify the chemical equation \nused to describe reduction reactions. [H] represents a \nhydrogen atom from the reducing agent. The 2 in front  \nof the [H] is necessary to balance the equation for \nhydrogen atoms.\nQuestion\n12\t Classify these reactions, choosing from the types of \nreaction described above:\na\t \u0007C3H7I  +  H2O \n C3H7OH  +  HI\nb\t \u0007CH3CHO  +  2[H] \n CH3CH2OH\nc\t\n\u0007C2H5Br \n C2H4  +  HBr\nd\t C2H4  +  H2O \n C2H5OH\ne\t \u0007C2H6  +  Cl2 \n C2H5Cl  +  HCl",
