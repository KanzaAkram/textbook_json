An ionic bond is sometimes called an electrovalent \nbond. In an ionic structure, the ions are arranged in a \nregular repeating pattern (see Chapter 5). As a result of \nthis, the force between one ion and the ions of opposite \ncharge that surround it is very great. In other words, ionic \nbonding is very strong.\n50\nDot-and-cross diagrams\nYou will notice that in Figure 4.2 we used dots and crosses to \nshow the electronic configuration of the chloride and sodium \nions. This helps us keep track of where the electrons have come \nfrom. It does not mean that the electron transferred is any \ndifferent from the others. Diagrams like this are called  \ndot-and-cross diagrams.\nWhen drawing a dot-and-cross diagram for an ionic \ncompound it is usually acceptable to draw the outer \nelectron shell of the metal ion without any electrons. This \nis because it has transferred these electrons to the negative \nion. Figure 4.4 shows the outer shell dot-and-cross \ndiagram for sodium chloride.\nA dot-and-cross diagram shows:\n■\n■\nthe outer electron shells only\n■\n■\nthat the charge of the ion is spread evenly, by using  \nsquare brackets\n■\n■\nthe charge on each ion, written at the top right-hand corner \nof the square brackets.\n\n+\n–\nNa\nCl\nFigure 4.4  Dot-and-cross diagram for sodium chloride.\nSome examples of dot-and-cross \ndiagrams\nMagnesium oxide\nWhen magnesium reacts with oxygen to form magnesium \noxide, the two electrons in the outer shell of each magnesium \natom are transferred to the incompletely filled orbitals of \nan oxygen atom. By losing two electrons, each magnesium \natom achieves the electronic configuration [2,8] (Figure \n4.5). By gaining two electrons, each oxygen atom achieves \nthe electronic configuration [2,8]. [2,8] is the electronic \nconfiguration of neon; it is a ‘noble-gas configuration’.\n2–\n2+\nMg\nO\nO\nMg\n2,8,2\n2,6\n[2,8]2+\n[2,8]2–\nMgO\nFigure 4.5  Dot-and-cross diagram for magnesium oxide.\nCalcium chloride\nEach calcium atom has two electrons in its outer shell, and \nthese can be transferred to two chlorine atoms. By losing \ntwo electrons, each calcium atom achieves the electronic \nconfiguration [2,8,8] (Figure 4.6). The two chlorine \natoms each gain one electron to achieve the electronic \nconfiguration [2,8,8].

A shared pair of electrons \nis called a single covalent bond, or a bond pair. A single \ncovalent bond is represented by a single line between the \natoms: for example, Cl   Cl.\nb\na\nFigure 4.7  a  Bromine and b  iodine are elements. They both \nhave simple covalent molecules.\n\nChapter 4: Chemical bonding\nYou can see that when chlorine atoms combine not all \nthe electrons are used in bonding. The pairs of outer-shell \nelectrons not used in bonding are called lone pairs. Each \natom in a chlorine molecule has three lone pairs  \nof electrons and shares one bonding pair of electrons \n(Figure 4.8).\na shared pair \nof electrons is a\ncovalent bond\nCl\nCl\nCl\n+\nCl\nCl\nCl\nchlorine atoms\n(2,8,7)\nchlorine molecule:\neach chlorine is now 2,8,8\nFigure 4.8  Atoms of chlorine share electrons to form a single \ncovalent bond.\nWhen drawing the arrangement of electrons in a  \nmolecule we:\n■\n■\nuse a ‘dot’ for electrons from one of the atoms and a ‘cross’ \nfor the electrons from the other atom\n■\n■\nif there are more than two types of atom we can use \nadditional symbols such as a small circle or a small triangle\n■\n■\nwe draw the outer electrons in pairs, to emphasise the \nnumber of bond pairs and the number of lone pairs.\n51\nSome examples of dot-and-cross diagrams for simple \ncovalently bonded molecules are shown in Figure 4.9.\nThere are some cases in which the electrons around  \na central atom may not have a noble gas configuration.  \nFor example:\n■\n■\nboron trifluoride, BF3, has only six electrons around  \nthe boron atom; we say that the boron atom is  \n‘electron deficient’\n■\n■\nsulfur hexafluoride, SF6, has twelve electrons around the \ncentral sulfur atom; we say that the sulfur atom has an \n‘expanded octet’ (Figure 4.10).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\na\nHydrogen\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\n+\ntwo hydrogen\natoms (1)\nhydrogen molecule\neach hydrogen is now (2)\nb\nMethane\nH\nH\nC\nC\n+\nC\nH\n4\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nfour\nhydrogen\natoms (1)\nmethane molecule: each\nhydrogen now shares two\nelectrons with carbon\ncarbon\natom\n(2,4)\nc\nWater\nO\nO\nH\n+\nO\nH\n2\nH\nH\nH\ntwo\nhydrogen\natoms (1)\noxygen\natom\n(2,6)\nwater molecule: hydrogen and\noxygen both ﬁll their outer shells\nby sharing electrons\nd\nAmmonia\nN\n+\nN\nN\nH\n3\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\n52\nH\nthree\nhydrogen\natoms (1)\nnitrogen\natom\n(2,5)\nammonia molecule: hydrogen\nand nitrogen both ﬁll their\nouter shells by sharing electrons\ne\nHydrogen chloride\nH\nCl\nCl\nH\nCl\nH\n+\nhydrogen\natom\n(1)\nchlorine\natom \n(2,8,7)\nhydrogen chloride molecule:\nhydrogen and chlorine both\nﬁll their outer shells by\nsharing electrons\nFigure 4.9  Dot-and-cross diagrams for some covalent \ncompounds: a  hydrogen, H2, b  methane, CH4, c  water, H2O, \nd  ammonia, NH3, and e  hydrogen chloride, HCl.\n\nBoron triﬂuoride\na\nF\nF\nF\nB\nF\nB\nF\nB\n3\n+\nF\nF\nthree\nﬂuorine\natoms (2,7)\nboron\natom (2,3)\nboron triﬂuoride\nmolecule\nSulfur hexaﬂuoride\nb\nF\nF\nF\nF\nS\n+\nF\nF\nF\nS\nS\nF\nF\n6\nF\nF\nF\nF\nsix\nﬂuorine\natoms (2,7)\nsulfur\natom\n(2,8,6)\nsulfur hexaﬂuoride\nmolecule\nFigure 4.10  Dot-and-cross diagrams for a  boron trifluoride, \nBF3, and b  sulfur hexafluoride, SF6.\nQuestion\n2\t \u0007Draw dot-and-cross diagrams for the following \ncovalently bonded molecules.

We call this a double covalent bond. A double \ncovalent bond is represented by a double line between the \natoms: for example, O   O. The dot-and-cross diagrams \nfor oxygen, carbon dioxide and ethene, all of which have \ndouble covalent bonds, are shown in Figure 4.11.\n■\n■\nIn order to form an oxygen molecule, each oxygen atom \nneeds to gain two electrons to complete its outer shell. So \ntwo pairs of electrons are shared and two covalent bonds \nare formed.\n■\n■\nFor carbon dioxide, each oxygen atom needs to gain two \nelectrons as before. But the carbon atom needs to gain four \nelectrons to complete its outer shell. So two oxygen atoms \neach form two bonds with carbon, so that the carbon atom \nhas eight electrons around it.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\na\nOxygen\nO\n+\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\ntwo oxygen atoms\n(2,6)\noxygen molecule\nb\nCarbon dioxide\nC\nC\n+\nC\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\ntwo oxygen\natoms (2,6)\ncarbon \natom (2,4)\ncarbon dioxide\nmolecule\nc\nEthene\nH\nC\nH\nH\n+\nH\nC\nC H\nH\nH\nH\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nC\nH\nfour \nhydrogen\natoms (1)\ntwo \ncarbon\natoms (2,4)\nethene molecule\nFigure 4.11  Dot-and-cross diagrams for a  oxygen, O2, \nb  carbon dioxide, CO2, and c  ethene, C2H4.\n■\n■\nIn ethene, two hydrogen atoms share a pair of electrons \nwith each carbon atom. This leaves each carbon atom with \ntwo outer shell electrons for bonding with each other. A \ndouble bond is formed.\nAtoms can also bond together by sharing three pairs of \nelectrons. We call this a triple covalent bond. Figure 4.12 \nshows a dot-and-cross diagram for the triple-bonded \nnitrogen molecule.\nIn order to form a nitrogen molecule, each nitrogen \natom needs to gain three electrons to complete its outer \nshell.

The \nhydrogen ion is electron deficient; it has space for two \nelectrons in its shell. The nitrogen atom in the ammonia \nmolecule has a lone pair of electrons. The lone pair on \nthe nitrogen atom provides both electrons for the bond \n(Figure 4.13).\nIn a displayed formula (which shows all atoms and \nbonds), a co-ordinate bond is represented by an arrow. \nThe head of the arrow points away from the lone pair that \nforms the bond.\nAnother molecule that has co-ordinate bonds is \naluminium chloride. At high temperatures aluminium \nchloride exists as molecules with the formula AlCl3. This \nmolecule is electron deficient; it still needs two electrons to \ncomplete the outer shell of the aluminium atom. At lower\n53\n+\nH\nH\n+\nN\nH\nH\n+\nH\nN\nH\nH\nH\n+\nH\nN\nH\nH\nH",
