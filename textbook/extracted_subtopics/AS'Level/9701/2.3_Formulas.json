The molecular \nformula is more useful than the empirical formula. We \nuse the molecular formula to write balanced equations \nand to calculate molar masses. The molecular formula is \nalways a multiple of the empirical formula. For example, \nthe molecular formula of ethane, C2H6, is two times the \nempirical formula, CH3.\nIn order to deduce the molecular formula we need  \nto know:\n■\n■\nthe relative formula mass of the compound\n■\n■\nthe empirical formula.\nworked example\n10\t A compound has the empirical formula CH2Br.

The formula of an ionic compound is determined by \nthe charges on each of the ions present. The number of positive \ncharges is balanced by the number of negative charges so that \nthe total charge on the compound is zero. We can work out the \nformula for a compound if we know the charges on the ions. \nFigure 1.11 shows the charges on some simple ions related to \nthe position of the elements in the Periodic Table. The form \nof the Periodic Table that we shall be using has 18 groups \nbecause the transition elements are numbered as Groups \n3 to 12. So, aluminium is in Group 13 and chlorine is in \nGroup 17.\nFor simple metal ions in Groups 1 and 2, the value of \nthe positive charge is the same as the group number. For \na simple metal ion in Group 13, the value of the positive \ncharge is 3+. For a simple non-metal ion in Groups 15 to \n17, the value of the negative charge is 18 minus the group\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n18\nGroup\nnone\nH+\n1\n2\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\nO2–\nF–\nLi+\nBe2+\nnone\nS2–\nAl3+\nCl–\nMg2+\nNa+\nnone\nBr–\nK+\nCa2+\nnone\nGa3+\ntransition\nelements\nI–\nRb+\nSr2+\nnone\nFigure 1.11  The charge on some simple ions is related to \ntheir position in the Periodic Table.\nnumber.

For example, iron forms two types of ions, Fe2+ and \nFe3+ (Figure 1.12).\nFigure 1.12  Iron(II) chloride (left) and iron(III) chloride (right). \nThese two chlorides of iron both contain iron and chlorine, \nbut they have different formulae.\nIons that contain more than one type of atom are called \ncompound ions. Some common compound ions that you \nshould learn are listed in Table 1.3.

(3 × 2−) + (2 × 3+) = 0\nSo the formula is Al2O3.\nThe formula of a covalent compound is deduced from the \nnumber of electrons needed to achieve the stable electronic \nconfiguration of a noble gas (see page 49). In general, \ncarbon atoms form four bonds with other atoms, hydrogen \nand halogen atoms form one bond and oxygen atoms form \ntwo bonds. So the formula of water, H2O, follows these \nrules. The formula for methane is CH4, with each carbon \natom bonding with four hydrogen atoms. However, there \nare many exceptions to these rules.\nCompounds containing a simple metal ion and non-\nmetal ion are named by changing the end of the name of \nthe non-metal element to -ide.\n11\nsodium + chlorine  \n  sodium chloride\nzinc + sulfur  \n  zinc sulfide\nCompound ions containing oxygen are usually called \n-ates.

So there must be the same number of each \ntype of atom on the reactants side of a chemical equation \nas there are on the products side. A symbol equation is a \nshorthand way of describing a chemical reaction. It shows \nthe number and type of the atoms in the reactants and the \nnumber and type of atoms in the products. If these are \nthe same, we say the equation is balanced. Follow these \nexamples to see how we balance an equation.\nworked examples\n13\t Balancing an equation\nStep 1  Write down the formulae of all the reactants and \nproducts. For example:\nH2\t\n+\t\nO2\t\n\t\nH2O\nStep 2  Count the number of atoms of each reactant \nand product.\nH2\t\n+\t\nO2\t\n\t\nH2O\n2[H]\t\n\t\n2[O]\t\n\t\n 2[H] + 1[O]\nStep 3  Balance one of the atoms by placing a number \nin front of one of the reactants or products. In this case \nthe oxygen atoms on the right-hand side need to be \nbalanced, so that they are equal in number to those on \nthe left-hand side. Remember that the number in front \nmultiplies everything in the formula. For example, 2H2O \nhas 4 hydrogen atoms and 2 oxygen atoms.\n12\nH2\t\n+\t\nO2\t\n\t\n2H2O\n2[H]\t\n\t\n2[O]\t\n\t\n4[H] + 2[O]\nStep 4  Keep balancing in this way, one type of atom at \na time until all the atoms are balanced.\n2H2\t\n+\t\nO2\t\n\t\n2H2O\n4[H]\t\n\t\n2[O]\t\n\t\n 4[H] + 2[O]\nNote that when you balance an equation you must not \nchange the formulae of any of the reactants  \nor products.\n14\t Write a balanced equation for the reaction of iron(III) \noxide with carbon monoxide to form iron and carbon \ndioxide.\nStep 1\t formulae\t\nFe2O3\t +\t CO\t\n\t Fe\t\n+\t CO2\n\t\nStep 2\t count the\t\nFe2O3\t +\t CO\t\n\t Fe\t\n+\t CO2\n\t\n\t\nnumber\n\t\n\t\nof atoms\t\n2[Fe] +\t \t 1[C] +\t \t\n1[Fe]\t\t 1[C] +\n3[O]\t\n\t 1[O]\t\n\t\n\t\n\t 2[O]\n\nworked examples (continued)\nStep 3\t balance the\t Fe2O3\t + \tCO\t\n \t 2Fe\t\n+ \tCO2\niron\n\t\n\t\n\t\n2[Fe] +\t\t 1[C] +\t \t\n2[Fe]\t +\t 1[C] +\n\t\n\t\n\t\n3[O]\t\n\t 1[O]\t\n\t\n\t\n\t 2[O]\nStep 4\t balance the\t Fe2O3\t + \t3CO\t\n\t 2Fe\t\n+\t 3CO2\n\t\n\t\noxygen\t\n2[Fe] +\t\t 3[C] +\t \t\n2[Fe]\t +\t 3[C] +\n\t\n\t\n\t\n3[O]\t\n\t 3[O]\t\n\t\n\t\n\t 6[O]\nIn step 4 the oxygen in the CO2 comes from two places, \nthe Fe2O3 and the CO. In order to balance the equation, \nthe same number of oxygen atoms (3) must come from \nthe iron oxide as come from the carbon monoxide.\nQuestion\n12\t \u0007Write balanced equations for the following reactions.\n\u0007a\t \u0007Iron reacts with hydrochloric acid to form iron(II) \nchloride, FeCl2, and hydrogen.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)3, decomposes on \nheating to form aluminium oxide, Al2O3, and water.\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Hexane, C6H14, burns in oxygen to form carbon \ndioxide and water.\nUsing state symbols\nWe sometimes find it useful to specify the physical states \nof the reactants and products in a chemical reaction. This \nis especially important where chemical equilibrium and \nrates of reaction are being discussed (see Chapter 8 and \nChapter 9). We use the following state symbols:\n■\n■\n(s) solid\n■\n■\n(l) liquid\n■\n■\n(g) gas\n■\n■\n(aq) aqueous (a solution in water).\nState symbols are written after the formula of each \nreactant and product. For example:\nZnCO3(s) + H2SO4(aq) \n ZnSO4(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)\nQuestion\n13\t \u0007Write balanced equations, including state symbols, for \nthe following reactions.\n\u0007a\t \u0007Solid calcium carbonate reacts with aqueous \nhydrochloric acid to form water, carbon dioxide \nand an aqueous solution of calcium chloride.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nQuestion (continued)\n\u0007b\t \u0007An aqueous solution of zinc sulfate, ZnSO4,  \nreacts with an aqueous solution of sodium \nhydroxide. The products are a precipitate of zinc \nhydroxide, Zn(OH)2, and an aqueous solution of \nsodium sulfate.\nFigure 1.13  The reaction between calcium carbonate and \nhydrochloric acid.

For example:\nNaCl(s)  +  aq  \n  Na+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\nIonic compounds include salts such as sodium bromide, \nmagnesium sulfate and ammonium nitrate. Acids and \nalkalis also contain ions. For example H+(aq) and Cl–(aq) \nions are present in hydrochloric acid and Na+(aq) and  \nOH–(aq) ions are present in sodium hydroxide.\nMany chemical reactions in aqueous solution involve \nionic compounds. Only some of the ions in solution take \npart in these reactions.\nThe ions that play no part in the reaction are called \nspectator ions.\nAn ionic equation is simpler than a full chemical \nequation. It shows only the ions or other particles that are \nreacting. Spectator ions are omitted.

A precipitation reaction is a \nreaction where two aqueous solutions react to form a solid \n– the precipitate. For these reactions the method of writing \nthe ionic equation can be simplified.

The solvent is usually water. There \nare 1000 cm3 in a cubic decimetre.
