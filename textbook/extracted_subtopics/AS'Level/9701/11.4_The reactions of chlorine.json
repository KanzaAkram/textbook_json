When chlorine reacts with dilute \nalkali some chlorine atoms are reduced and some are \noxidised in the same reaction. The actual reaction that \ntakes place depends on the temperature.\nChlorine in cold alkali (15 °C)\nCl2(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) \n NaCl(aq) + NaClO(aq) + H2O(l)\n\t\nsodium chlorate(I)\nThe ionic equation for the reaction is:\nCl2(aq)  +  2OH−(aq)  \n  Cl−(aq)  +  ClO−(aq)  +  H2O(l)\n\t\n0\t\n−1\t\n+1 \noxidation number of Cl\nThe ionic equation for this redox reaction can be split into \ntwo half-equations, showing the reduction and oxidation.\n■\n■\nThe reduction reaction (in which chlorine’s oxidation \nnumber is reduced is):\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2  +  e−  \n  Cl−\n177\noxidation number of Cl\t\n0\t\n−1\n■\n■\nThe oxidation reaction is:\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2  +  2OH−  \n  ClO−  +  H2O  +  e−\noxidation number of Cl\t\n0\t\n+1\nChlorine in hot alkali (70 °C)\nWhen we add chlorine and hot concentrated aqueous \nsodium hydroxide a different disproportionation reaction \ntakes place:\n3Cl2(aq) + 6NaOH(aq) → 5NaCl(aq) + NaClO3(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n0\noxidation\nnumber of\n–1\n+5\nreduction\nCl\noxidation\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n5\t a\t \u0007What type of reaction takes place between \nchlorine and hot aqueous sodium hydroxide?\nb\t \u0007Write an ionic equation for the reaction of chlorine \nwith hot aqueous sodium hydroxide.\nc\t\n\u0007Write a half-equation to show the reduction \nreaction taking place in part b.\nd\t \u0007Write a half-equation to show the oxidation \nreaction taking place in part b.\ne\t \u0007Explain what happens in the reaction between \nchlorine and hot aqueous sodium hydroxide.\nf\t\n\u0007Name the compound NaClO3.\nUses of the halogens and their \ncompounds\nChlorination of water\nAdding a small amount of chlorine to a water supply \nwill kill bacteria and make the water safer to drink. The \nchlorine undergoes disproportionation in water:\noxidation\n           Cl2(aq)  +  H2O(l)  \n  HCl(aq)  +  HClO(aq)\n178\nnumber of Cl\t\n0\t\n−1\t\n+1\nHClO is called chloric(I) acid. It decomposes slowly in \nsolution. One theory suggests that it produces reactive \noxygen atoms that can kill bacteria in water:\nHClO  \n  HCl  +  [O]\nSummary\n■\t The halogens chlorine, bromine and iodine exist \nas covalent diatomic molecules. They become \nincreasingly less volatile and more deeply coloured \non descending Group 17. The volatility decreases as \nvan der Waals’ forces between molecules increase.\n■\t All the halogens are oxidising agents. Fluorine is the \nstrongest oxidising agent and iodine is the weakest.\n■\t The reactivity of the halogens decreases on \ndescending the group.\n■\t It gets easier to oxidise the hydrogen halides going \ndown Group 17 as the strength of the hydrogen–\nhalogen bond decreases.\n\nBleach\nBleach is an equal mixture of sodium chloride (NaCl) \nand sodium chlorate(I) (NaClO), made from chlorine and \ncold alkali. It ‘bleaches’ colours and stains because oxygen \natoms from the chlorate(I) ions oxidise dye and other \ncoloured molecules. They also kill bacteria when toilets are \ncleaned with bleach (see Figure 12.6).\nFigure 12.6  The reaction: Cl2(aq)  +  2NaOH(aq)\nNaCl(aq)  +  NaClO(aq)  +  H2O(l) is used in industry to \nproduce bleach. The bleaching agent is the chlorate(I) ion.\nOther uses\nThe halogens are found in many organic compounds \nsuch as the plastic PVC (poly(choroethene) or polyvinyl \nchloride) and halogenated hydrocarbons used as solvents, \nrefrigerants and in aerosols. For more details see ‘Uses of \nhalogenoalkanes’ on pages 222–3.\n■\t Chlorine reacts with cold hydroxide ions in a \ndisproportionation (‘self reduction-oxidation’) \nreaction. This reaction produces commercial bleach.\n■\t A different disproportionation reaction takes place \nbetween chlorine and hot alkali, producing NaCl(aq), \nNaClO3(aq) and water.\n■\t The halogens all have important industrial uses, \nespecially chlorine, which is used in the manufacture \nof many other useful products. Possibly the most \nimportant use of chlorine is in the prevention of \ndisease by chlorination of water supplies.",
