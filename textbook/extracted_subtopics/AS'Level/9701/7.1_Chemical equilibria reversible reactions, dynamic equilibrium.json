For \nexample, when magnesium reacts with excess \nhydrochloric acid, the reaction stops when all the \nmagnesium has been used up. The products cannot be \nconverted back to the reactants. This reaction  \nis irreversible.\nHowever, some reactions can be reversed. There is \nthe forward reaction, where reactants are converted \ninto products, and the reverse reaction, where the \nproducts are converted back into the reactants. When \nthe rates of the forward and reverse reactions balance, \nwe say the reversible reaction is in equilibrium.\nIt may help to think of other situations in which forces \nor processes are in equilibrium (Figure 8.1).\nReversible reactions and \nequilibrium\nReversible reactions\nSome reactions can be reversed. For example, when  \nblue, hydrated copper(II) sulfate is heated, it loses its \nwater of crystallisation and changes to white, anhydrous \ncopper(II) sulfate.\nCuSO4.5H2O(s)\t\n\t CuSO4(s)\t\n+\t 5H2O(l)\nhydrated copper(II)\t\t\nanhydrous\nsulfate\t\t\ncopper(II) sulfate\nThis is called the forward reaction.\nWhen water is added to anhydrous copper(II) sulfate, \nthe reaction is reversed.\nCuSO4(s)  +  5H2O(l)  \n  CuSO4.5H2O(s)\nThis is called the backward (or reverse) reaction.\nWe can show these two reactions in the same equation \nby using two arrows.\nCuSO4.5H2O(s)  \n  CuSO4(s)  +  5H2O(l)\nFigure 8.2  Hydrated copper(II) sulfate (left) and anhydrous \ncopper(II) sulfate (right).\n\nChapter 8: Equilibrium\nFigure 8.1  Both the moving belt and runner are moving. \nWhen the movement of the belt balances the movement of \nthe runner, they are in equilibrium.\nA reaction in which the products can react to re-form the \noriginal reactants is called a reversible reaction. In this \ncase heating and adding water are not being carried out \nat the same time. However, there is a type of chemical \nreaction in which the forward reaction and the backward \nreaction take place at the same time.\nIn many chemical reactions the reactants are not \nused up completely. Some products are formed but the \nmaximum theoretical yield is not obtained. A mixture \nof products and reactants is formed. The products react \ntogether to re-form reactants at the same time as the \nreactants are forming products. This type of reversible \nreaction is called an equilibrium reaction. We show that \nequilibrium reactions are reversible by the sign \n.\nFor example, consider the reaction between hydrogen \nand iodine carried out in a sealed glass tube at 400 °C:\n117\nH2(g)  +  I2(g)  \n  2HI(g)\nMolecules of hydrogen iodide are breaking down to \nhydrogen and iodine at the same rate as hydrogen  \nand iodine molecules are reacting together to form \nhydrogen iodide.\nhydrogen atom\niodine atom\nFigure 8.3  A snapshot of the dynamic equilibrium between \nhydrogen gas, iodine gas and hydrogen iodide gas.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nWhen fizzy drinks are made, carbon dioxide gas is \ndissolved in the drink under pressure. When you take the \nlid off a bottle of fizzy drink, bubbles of carbon dioxide \nsuddenly appear. When you put the lid back on, the \nbubbles stop. This is because of the equilibrium\nCO2(g)  \n  CO2(aq)\nThe forward reaction happens during manufacture and the \nbackward reaction happens on opening.\nCharacteristics of equilibrium\nAn equilibrium reaction has four particular features under \nconstant conditions:\n■\n■\nit is dynamic\n■\n■\nthe forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate\n■\n■\nthe concentrations of reactants and products remain \nconstant at equilibrium\n■\n■\nit requires a closed system.\n1  It is dynamic\nThe phrase dynamic equilibrium means that the \nmolecules or ions of reactants and products are \ncontinuously reacting. Reactants are continuously being \nchanged to products and products are continuously being \nchanged back to reactants.\n118\n2  The forward and backward reactions occur \nat the same rate\nAt equilibrium the rate of the forward reaction equals \nthe rate of the backward reaction. Molecules or ions \nof reactants are becoming products, and those in the \nproducts are becoming reactants, at the same rate.\n3  The concentrations of reactants and \nproducts remain constant at equilibrium\nThe concentrations remain constant because, at \nequilibrium, the rates of the forward and backward \nreactions are equal. The equilibrium can be approached \nfrom two directions. For example, in the reaction\nH2(g)  +  I2(g)  \n  2HI(g)\nWe can start by either:\n■\n■\nusing a mixture of colourless hydrogen gas and purple \niodine vapour, or\n■\n■\nusing only colourless hydrogen iodide gas.\n\nFigure 8.4 shows what happens when 5.00 mol of  \nhydrogen molecules and 5.00 mol of iodine molecules  \nreact at 500 K in a vessel of volume 1 dm3. As time \npasses, the purple colour of the iodine vapour fades \nuntil equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium the mixture \ncontains 0.68 mol of iodine, 0.68 mol of hydrogen and \n8.64 mol of hydrogen iodide.\n10.0\nequilibrium reached\nConcentration of reagent/10–3moldm–3\n9.0\n8.64\nline shows increase in\nconcentration of hydrogen\niodide as the equilibrium\nis established\n8.0\n7.0\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\nline shows decrease in\nconcentration of both\nhydrogen and iodine as the\nequilibrium is established\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.68\n0.0\n0\nTime\nFigure 8.4  The changes in the concentrations of reagents \nas 5.00 mol of each of hydrogen and iodine react to form \nan equilibrium mixture with hydrogen iodide in a vessel of \nvolume 1 dm3.\nFigure 8.5 shows that the same equilibrium can be \nachieved when 10.00 mol of hydrogen iodide molecules \ndecompose to iodine and hydrogen iodide.

In an open \nsystem some matter is lost to the surroundings. Figure \n8.6 shows the difference between a closed system and an \nopen system when calcium carbonate is heated at a high \ntemperature in a strong container.\nMany chemical reactions can be studied without \nplacing them in closed containers. They can reach \nequilibrium in open flasks if the reaction takes place \nentirely in solution and no gas is lost.\nChanging the position of \nequilibrium\na\nCaCO3(s)  \nCaO(s) + CO2(g)\nCaCO3(s)\nCaO(s)\nCO2(g)\nb\nCaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)\nFigure 8.6  a  A closed system. No carbon dioxide escapes. \nThe calcium carbonate is in equilibrium with calcium \noxide and carbon dioxide. b  An open system. The calcium \ncarbonate is continually decomposing as the carbon dioxide is \nlost.

Some liquid bromine is put \nin a closed jar. The colour of the bromine vapour \nabove the liquid gets darker and darker until the \ndepth of colour remains constant. Bromine liquid \nstill remains in the jar. Explain what is happening in \nterms of changes in concentration of the bromine \nmolecules in the vapour.\n119\nPosition of equilibrium\nThe position of equilibrium refers to the relative amounts of \nproducts and reactants present in an equilibrium mixture.\n■\n■\nIf a system in equilibrium is disturbed (e.g. by a change \nin temperature) and the concentration of products is \nincreased relative to the reactants, we say that the position \nof equilibrium has shifted to the right.\n■\n■\nIf the concentration of products is decreased relative to \nthe reactants, we say that the position of equilibrium has \nshifted to the left.\nLe Chatelier’s principle\nChanges in both concentration and temperature affect \nthe position of equilibrium. When any of the reactants or \nproducts are gases, changes in pressure may also affect the \nposition of equilibrium. French chemist Henri Le Chatelier \n(1850–1936) observed how these factors affect the position \nof equilibrium. He put forward a general rule, known as  \nLe Chatelier’s principle:\nIf one or more factors that affect an equilibrium is \nchanged, the position of equilibrium shifts in the direction \nthat reduces (opposes) the change.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nWe can predict the effect of changing concentration  \nand pressure by referring to the stoichiometric equation \nfor the reaction. We can predict the effect of changing  \nthe temperature by referring to the enthalpy change of  \nthe reaction.\nHow does change in concentration affect \nthe position of equilibrium?\nWhen the concentration of one or more of the reactants  \nis increased:\n■\n■\nthe system is no longer in equilibrium\n■\n■\nthe position of equilibrium moves to the right to reduce the \neffect of the increase in concentration of reactant\n■\n■\nmore products are formed until equilibrium is restored.\nWhen the concentration of one or more of the products  \nis increased:\n■\n■\nthe system is no longer in equilibrium\n■\n■\nthe position of equilibrium moves to the left to reduce the \neffect of the increase in concentration of product\n■\n■\nmore reactants are formed until equilibrium is restored.\nFor example, look at the reaction:\nCH3COOH(l)\t+\tC2H5OH(l)\t\n\tCH3COOC2H5(l)\t+\tH2O(l)\n120\nethanoic acid\t\n\t\nethanol\t\n\t\nethyl ethanoate\t\n\t\nwater\nWhat happens when we add more ethanol?\n■\n■\nThe concentration of ethanol is increased.\n■\n■\nAccording to Le Chatelier’s principle, some of the ethanol \nmust be removed to reduce the concentration of the  \nadded ethanol.\n■\n■\nThe position of equilibrium shifts to the right.\n■\n■\nMore ethanol reacts with ethanoic acid and more ethyl \nethanoate and water are formed.\nWhat happens when we add more water?\n■\n■\nThe concentration of water is increased.\n■\n■\nAccording to Le Chatelier’s principle, some of the water \nmust be removed to reduce the concentration of the  \nadded water.\n■\n■\nThe position of equilibrium shifts to the left.\n■\n■\nSo more water reacts with ethyl ethanoate and more \nethanoic acid and ethanol are formed.\nWhat happens when we remove some water?\n■\n■\nThe concentration of water is decreased.\n■\n■\nAccording to Le Chatelier’s principle, some water must be \nadded to increase its concentration.\n■\n■\nThe position of equilibrium shifts to the right.\n■\n■\nSo more ethanoic acid reacts with ethanol and more water \nand ethyl ethanoate are formed.\n\nQuestion\n3\t a\t Use this reaction:\nCH3COOH(l)  +  C2H5OH(l)\nCH3COOC2H5(l)  +  H2O(l)\n\u0007Explain what happens to the position of \nequilibrium when:\ni\t\nmore CH3COOC2H5(l) is added\nii\t some C2H5OH(l) is removed.\nb\t Use this reaction:\nCe4+(aq)  +  Fe2+(aq)  \n  Ce3+(aq)  +  Fe3+(aq)\n\u0007Explain what happens to the position of \nequilibrium when:\ni\t\nthe concentration of Fe2+(aq) ions is increased\nii\t water is added to the equilibrium mixture.\nFigure 8.7  Stalactites and stalagmites are formed as a result \nof water passing through rocks containing calcium carbonate. \nThe solution running through these rocks contains water, \ndissolved carbon dioxide and calcium hydrogencarbonate:\nCaCO3(s)  +  H2O(l)  +  CO2(aq)  \n  Ca(HCO3)2(aq)\nWhen droplets of this mixture are formed on the roof of the \ncave, some of the carbon dioxide in the droplets escapes \ninto the air. The position of equilibrium shifts to the left and \ncalcium carbonate is deposited.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nThe effect of pressure on the position  \nof equilibrium\nChange in pressure only affects reactions where gases \nare reactants or products. The molecules or ions in solids \nand liquids are packed closely together and cannot be \ncompressed very easily. In gases, the molecules are far \napart (Figure 8.8).\nhigher pressure\nmeans higher\nconcentration\ngas\nlower pressure means\nlower concentration\nFigure 8.8  Pressure has a considerable effect on the \nconcentration of gases.\nThe pressure of a gas is caused by the molecules hitting the \nwalls of the container. Each molecule in a mixture of gases \ncontributes towards the total pressure. So, at constant \ntemperature, the more gas molecules there are in a given \nvolume, the higher the pressure.\nFigure 8.9 shows what happens when we increase the \npressure on the reaction represented by:\nX(g)\t\n+\t\nY(g)\t\n\t\nZ(g)\n1 mol\t\n\t\n1 mol\t\n\t\n1 mol\nIn this reaction there are two moles of gas on the left \nand one on the right. When the pressure is increased at \nconstant temperature:\n■\n■\nthe molecules are closer together, because the pressure  \nhas increased\n■\n■\nthe position of equilibrium shifts to minimise this increase\n■\n■\nit shifts in the direction of fewer gas molecules (in the \ndirection that opposes the increase in pressure)\n■\n■\nmore product, Z, is formed from X and Y until equilibrium  \nis re-established.\n\nChapter 8: Equilibrium\na  Initial pressure\n13 molecules\ncontributing to\nthe pressure.\nX\nZ\nY\n+\nb  Pressure is increased\nMore molecules\nof Z are formed,\nreducing the total\nnumber of molecules\nfrom 13 to 11.\nFigure 8.9  An increase in pressure in this case causes  \nthe equilibrium to shift to the right, to produce more \nmolecules of Z than before, but fewer molecules in the \nreaction vessel overall.\nFor example, consider the reaction:\n2SO2(g)  +  O2(g)  \n  2SO3(g)\nThere are three moles of gas molecules on the left of the \nequation and two on the right.\nWhat happens when we increase the pressure?\n121\n■\n■\nThe molecules are closer together, because the pressure  \nis higher.\n■\n■\nAccording to Le Chatelier’s principle, the reaction must  \nshift in the direction that reduces the number of molecules \nof gas.\n■\n■\nThe position of equilibrium shifts to the right.\n■\n■\nSo more SO2 reacts with O2 to form SO3.\nWhat happens when we decrease the pressure?\n■\n■\nThe molecules are further apart, because the pressure  \nis lower.\n■\n■\nAccording to Le Chatelier’s principle, the reaction must  \nshift in the direction that increases the number of molecules \nof gas.\n■\n■\nThe position of equilibrium shifts to the left.\n■\n■\nSo more SO2 and O2 molecules are formed by the \ndecomposition of SO3 molecules.\nTable 8.1 summarises the effect of changes in pressure on \ntwo other gas reactions.\nnote that:\n■\n■\nif there are equal numbers of molecules of gas on each side \nof the equation, the position of equilibrium is not affected \nby a change in pressure\n■\n■\nin a reaction involving gases and solids (or liquids), it is only \nthe molecules of gases that count when determining how \npressure affects the position of equilibrium.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nChange in \npressure\nFewer molecules of \ngas on right\nN2(g)  +  3H2(g)\nMore molecules of \ngas on right\nN2O4(g)  \n  2NO2\n2NH3(g)\nequilibrium position \nshifts towards reactants: \nmore N2O4 forms\npressure \nincrease\nequilibrium position \nshifts towards products: \nmore NH3 forms\nequilibrium position \nshifts towards products: \nmore NO2 forms\npressure \ndecrease\nequilibrium position \nshifts towards reactants: \nmore N2 and H2 form\nTable 8.1  The effect of changes in pressure on gas reactions.\nQuestion\n4\t a\t \u0007Predict the effect of increasing the pressure on the \nfollowing reactions:\ni\t\nN2O4(g)  \n  2NO2(g)\nii\t CaCO3(s)  \n  CaO(s)  +  CO2(g)\nb\t \u0007Predict the effect of decreasing the pressure on \nthe reaction:\n2NO2(g)  \n  2NO(g)  +  O2(g)\n122\nThe effect of temperature on the position \nof equilibrium\nThe decomposition of hydrogen iodide is an endothermic \nreaction.\n2HI  \n  H2  +  I2\t\nΔHr = +9.6 kJ mol–1\nThe effect of temperature on the equilibrium concentration of \nhydrogen iodide and hydrogen at equilibrium for the forward \nreaction is shown in Table 8.2.\nTemperature / °C\nEquilibrium \nconcentration of \nHI / mol dm–3\nEquilibrium \nconcentration \nof H2 (or I2) / \nmol dm–3\n25\n0.934\n0.033\n230\n0.864\n0.068\n430\n0.786\n0.107\n490\n0.773\n0.114\nTable 8.2  Effect of temperature on the decomposition of \nhydrogen iodide.\nYou can see from Table 8.2 that, as the temperature \nincreases, the concentration of product increases.

Catalysts speed up the time taken to \nreach equilibrium, but they have no effect on the  \nposition of equilibrium once this is reached. This is \nbecause they increase the rate of the forward and reverse \nreactions equally.\nEquilibrium expressions and the \nequilibrium constant, Kc\nEquilibrium expressions\nWhen hydrogen reacts with iodine in a closed tube at \n500 K, the following equilibrium is set up:\nH2  +  I2  \n  2HI\nTable 8.4 shows the relationship between the equilibrium \nconcentrations of H2, I2 and HI.

The equilibrium reaction involved is:\nN2(g)  +  3H2(g)  \n  2NH3(g)\b\nΔHr = –92 kJ mol–1\nWe can use Le Chatelier’s principle to show how to get the \nbest yield of ammonia. At high temperatures, when the \nreaction is faster, the position of equilibrium is to the left \nbecause the reaction is exothermic (ΔH is negative).\n■\n■\nWhat happens if we increase the pressure?\n–\t When we increase the pressure, the reaction goes in  \nthe direction that results in fewer molecules of gas  \nbeing formed.\n–\t The equilibrium shifts in the direction that reduces  \nthe pressure.\n–\t In this case there are four molecules of gas on the \nleft-hand side and two on the right-hand side. So the \nequilibrium shifts towards the right.\n–\t The yield of ammonia increases.\n\nChapter 8: Equilibrium\n■\n■\nWhat happens if we decrease the temperature?\n–\t A decrease in temperature decreases the energy of  \nthe surroundings.\n–\t The reaction will go in the direction in which energy  \nis released.\n–\t Energy is released in the exothermic reaction, in \nwhich the position of equilibrium favours ammonia \nproduction.\n–\t This shifts the position of equilibrium to the right. The \nvalue of Kp increases.\n■\n■\nWhat happens if we remove ammonia by condensing it to a \nliquid? We can do this because ammonia has a much higher \nboiling point than hydrogen and nitrogen.\n–\t The position of equilibrium shifts to the right to replace \nthe ammonia that has been removed.\n–\t More ammonia is formed from hydrogen and nitrogen to \nkeep the value of Kp constant.\nEquilibrium and the production of \nsulfuric acid\nThe synthesis of sulfuric acid is carried out by the Contact \nprocess. The main equilibrium reaction involved is:\n129\n2SO2(g)  +  O2(g)  \n  2SO3(g)\b\nΔHr = –197 kJ mol–1\nWe can use Le Chatelier’s principle to show how to get the \nbest yield of sulfur trioxide.\n■\n■\nWhat happens when we increase the pressure?\n–\t When we increase the pressure, the reaction goes in the \ndirection that results in fewer molecules of gas being \nformed, to reduce the pressure.\n–\t There are three molecules of gas on the left-hand side \nand two on the right-hand side, so the equilibrium shifts \ntowards the right.\nHowever, in practice, the reaction is carried out at just \nabove atmospheric pressure. This is because the value of Kp \nis very high. The position of equilibrium is far over to the \nright even at atmospheric pressure. Very high pressure is \nunnecessary, and is not used as it is expensive.\n■\n■\nWhat happens if we decrease the temperature?\n–\t Decreasing the temperature shifts the position of \nequilibrium to the right.\n–\t A decrease in temperature decreases the energy of the \nsurroundings so the reaction will go in the direction in \nwhich energy is released.\n–\t This is the exothermic reaction, in which the position of \nequilibrium favours SO3 production. The value of  \nKp increases.",
