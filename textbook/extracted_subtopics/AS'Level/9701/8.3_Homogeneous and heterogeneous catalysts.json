The \ndistribution of molecular energies changes as we raise the \ntemperature, as shown in Figure 9.9. The curve showing the \nBoltzmann distribution at the higher temperature flattens \nand the peak shifts to the right.\nThe area under the curve represents the number of \nparticles. The shaded area shows the number of particles \nwith energy greater than the activation energy, Ea. For \na 10 °C rise in temperature this area under the curve \napproximately doubles, as does the rate of many reactions.\nTherefore, increasing the temperature increases the rate \nof reaction because:\n■\n■\nthe increased energy results in particles moving around \nmore quickly, which increases the frequency of collisions\n■\n■\nthe proportion of successful collisions (i.e. those that result \nin a reaction) increases because the proportion of particles \nexceeding the activation energy increases. This is the more \nimportant factor.\nwhen the sample is heated, the mean energy of the\nmolecules increases. There is a wider spread of values\nNumber of molecules\na greater proportion of \nmolecules than before exceed\nthe activation energy, so\nincreasing rate of reaction\nEa \nT °C\n144\n(T+10)°C\n0\n0\nMolecular energy\nEa – at and above this energy\nthe molecules have enough\nenergy to collide eﬀectively\nFigure 9.9  The Boltzmann distribution of molecular  \nenergies at temperatures T °C and (T + 10) °C, showing the \nactivation energy.\nQuestion\n3\t a\t \u0007What is the Boltzmann distribution?\nb\t \u0007Explain why a 10 °C rise in temperature can \napproximately double the rate of a reaction.\nCatalysis\nIn Figure 9.6 we saw how a catalyst works by providing \nan alternative mechanism (or reaction pathway) with a \nlower activation energy. We can show this on a Boltzmann \ndistribution (see Figure 9.10).\nNote that the presence of a catalyst does not affect the \nshape of the Boltzmann distribution. However, by providing \na lower activation energy, a greater proportion of molecules\n\nNumber of molecules\ncoloured areas indicate the proportion\nof molecules whose energy exceeds\nthe activation energies Ea(cat) and Ea\nmolecules with\nthese low energies\ncannot react\nMolecular energy\nEa(cat)\nEa\n0\n0\nFigure 9.10  The Boltzmann distribution of molecular \nenergies, showing the change in activation energy with and \nwithout a catalyst.\nin the reaction mixture have sufficient energy to react. \nThe shaded area under the curve represents the numbers \nof molecules that have energy greater than the activation \nenergy of the reaction. The total shaded area (including \nboth the light and dark shading) under the curve shows the \nnumber of particles with energy greater than the activation \nenergy with the catalyst present (Ea(cat)). This area is much \nlarger than the dark shaded area for the reaction without a \ncatalyst. Therefore the rate at which effective collisions occur, \nand so the rate of the catalysed reaction, is greatly increased \ncompared with the rate of the uncatalysed reaction.\nHomogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts\nWhen a catalyst and the reactants in a catalysed reaction \nare in the same phase, the catalyst is described as a \nhomogeneous catalyst. For example, a catalyst can be \ndescribed as homogeneous if it is dissolved in water and the \nreactants are also present as an aqueous solution.\nIf the catalyst is in a different phase to the reactants, the \ncatalyst is described as a heterogeneous catalyst. You have \nprobably met an example of heterogeneous catalysis when \nmaking oxygen gas. The reaction commonly used  \nin the laboratory is the decomposition of hydrogen \nperoxide solution:\n2H2O2(aq)  \n  2H2O(l)  +  O2(g)\t\nslow reaction\nThis is a very slow reaction at room temperature. However, \nwhen a little of the insoluble solid manganese(IV) oxide \npowder, MnO2(s), is added, oxygen is given off quickly \n(Figure 9.11).\nMnO2(s)\n2H2O(l)  +  O2(g)\t fast reaction\n2H2O2(aq)\nAt the end of the reaction, when no more gas is being \nreleased, the solid catalyst can be recovered by filtering  \noff the water and drying the black powder of \nmanganese(IV) oxide.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\na\nb\nFigure 9.11  a  A solution of hydrogen peroxide at room \ntemperature. b  The solution of hydrogen peroxide with a little \nmanganese(IV) oxide added.\nMany heterogeneous catalysts are solids that catalyse \ngaseous reactants. The reactions take place on the surface \nof the solid catalyst. There are many examples in industry, \nincluding the iron catalyst used in the manufacture of \nammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas, and the \nnickel catalyst used when adding hydrogen gas to vegetable \noils to make margarine.\nEnzymes\nEnzymes are biological catalysts. They are large protein \nmolecules which enable the biochemical reactions that \nhappen in living things to take place very quickly at \nrelatively low temperatures. Most enzyme-catalysed \nreactions happen in solution and are examples of \nhomogeneous catalysis.\nIn common with inorganic catalysts, enzymes:\n■\n■\nspeed up a reaction without being used up\n■\n■\nprovide an alternative reaction pathway with a lower \nactivation energy (Figure 9.12).\nE–S\nE+P\nEnthalpy\nEa for the\nuncatalysed\nreaction\n∆Hr\nE+S\nEa for the catalysed\nreaction\nFigure 9.12  The energy profile for an enzyme-catalysed \nendothermic reaction, compared with the same reaction \nwithout a catalyst. As for inorganic catalysts, the enzyme \nprovides a different reaction pathway with a lower activation \nenergy (Ea) but the overall enthalpy change (∆Hr) is unaffected.\n\nChapter 9: Rates of reaction\nHowever, enzyme catalysis has some specific features:\n■\n■\nenzymes are more efficient than inorganic catalysts; the \nreaction rate is often increased by a factor of 106 to 1012\n■\n■\nenzymes are very specific; they usually only catalyse one \nparticular reaction\n■\n■\nas a consequence of this specificity, enzymes do not \nproduce byproducts\n■\n■\nenzymes work under very mild conditions; for example \n35 °C, pH 7, atmospheric pressure\n■\n■\nthe amount of enzyme present in a cell can be regulated \naccording to need.\nThe specific substance that fits onto the surface of the \nenzyme molecule and is converted to product(s) is  \ncalled a substrate. For example: the enzyme urease \ncatalyses the reaction:\n(NH2)2CO  +  H2O \n 2NH3  +  CO2\n\t\nurea\nUrea is the substrate in this reaction, because it fits  \nonto the surface of the enzyme molecule. Water reacts \nwith the urea, but only when the urea is bound to the \nenzyme molecule.\nQuestion\n145\n4\t a\t i\t\n\u0007Explain whether the reaction below is an \nexample of heterogeneous or homogeneous \ncatalysis:\nV2O5(s)\n \t\n   2SO2(g)  +  O2(g)  \n  2SO3(g)\nii\t \u0007Explain how a catalyst increases the rate of \nreaction in terms of activation energy and the \ndistribution of molecular energies in a sample \nof reactants.\nb\t \u0007Enzymes are used in the biotechnology industry. \nThey are far more efficient than traditional catalysts \nused in industrial processes. What would be the \nbenefits of using enzymes instead of traditional \ncatalysts in the industrial production of a chemical?\nc\t\n\u0007Draw an energy profile diagram to show a typical \nuncatalysed reaction and an enzyme-catalysed \nreaction. On your diagram show:\ni\t\n\u0007the activation energy for the catalysed and \nuncatalysed reactions\nii\t \u0007the enzyme, substrate and product and \nenzyme–substrate intermediate.",
