To calculate this we need to know \nthe chemical equation. This shows us the ratio of moles \nof the reactants and products – the stoichiometry of the \nequation. The balanced equation shows this stoichiometry. \nFor example, in the reaction\nFe2O3  +  3CO  \n  2Fe  +  3CO2\n1 mole of iron(III) oxide reacts with 3 moles of carbon \nmonoxide to form 2 moles of iron and 3 moles of carbon \ndioxide. The stoichiometry of the equation is 1 : 3 : 2 : 3.  \nThe large numbers that are included in the equation  \n(3, 2 and 3) are called stoichiometric numbers.\nIn order to find the mass of products formed in a \nchemical reaction we use:\n■\n■\nthe mass of the reactants\n■\n■\nthe molar mass of the reactants\n■\n■\nthe balanced equation.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nFigure 1.9  Iron reacting with sulfur to produce iron sulfide. \nWe can calculate exactly how much iron is needed to react \nwith sulfur and the mass of the products formed by  \nknowing the molar mass of each reactant and the balanced \nchemical equation.\nworked example\n3\t Magnesium burns in oxygen to form magnesium oxide.\n2Mg  +  O2  \n  2MgO\nWe can calculate the mass of oxygen needed to react \nwith 1 mole of magnesium. We can calculate the mass \nof magnesium oxide formed.\nStep 1  Write the balanced equation.\nStep 2  Multiply each formula mass in g by the \nrelevant stoichiometric number in the equation.\n2Mg\t\n+\t\nO2\t\n \n \t\n2MgO\n\t 2 × 24.3 g\t\n\t 1 × 32.0 g\t\n\t\n2 × (24.3 g  +  16.0 g)\n\t\n48.6 g\t\n\t\n32.0 g\t\n\t\n80.6 g\nFrom this calculation we can deduce that:\n■\n■\n32.0 g of oxygen are needed to react exactly with \n48.6 g of magnesium\n■\n■\n80.6 g of magnesium oxide are formed.\nIf we burn 12.15 g of magnesium (0.5 mol) we get \n20.15 g of magnesium oxide. This is because the \nstoichiometry of the reaction shows us that for every \nmole of magnesium burnt we get the same number of \nmoles of magnesium oxide.\nIn this type of calculation we do not always need to know \nthe molar mass of each of the reactants. If one or more of \nthe reactants is in excess, we need only know the mass in \ngrams and the molar mass of the reactant that is not in \nexcess (the limiting reactant).\n\nChapter 1: Moles and equations\nworked example\n4\t Iron(III) oxide reacts with carbon monoxide to form \niron and carbon dioxide.\nFe2O3  +  3CO  \n  2Fe  +  3CO2\nCalculate the maximum mass of iron produced when \n798 g of iron(III) oxide is reduced by excess carbon \nmonoxide.\n\t\n(Ar values: Fe = 55.8, O = 16.0)\nStep 1\t Fe2O3  +  3CO  \n  2Fe  +  3CO2\n\t\nStep 2\t 1 mole iron(III) oxide \t\n 2 moles iron\n(2 × 55.8) + (3 × 16.0) \t\n 2 × 55.8\n159.6 g Fe2O3 \t \t\n 111.6 g Fe\nStep 3\t 798 g\t\n​ 111.6 \n_____ \n159.6 ​ × 798\n= 558 g Fe\nYou can see that in step 3, we have simply used ratios \nto calculate the amount of iron produced from 798 g of \niron(III) oxide.\nquestion\n7\n5\t \u0007a\t \u0007Sodium reacts with excess oxygen to form sodium \nperoxide, Na2O2.\n2Na  +  O2  \n  Na2O2\n\u0007Calculate the maximum mass of sodium  \nperoxide formed when 4.60 g of sodium is burnt  \nin excess oxygen.\n\t\n\t\n(Ar values: Na = 23.0, O = 16.0)\n\u0007b\t \u0007Tin(IV) oxide is reduced to tin by carbon.

Give your answer to 3 \nsignificant figures.\n\t\n\t\n(Ar values: C = 12.0, O = 16.0, Sn = 118.7)\nThe stoichiometry of a reaction\nWe can find the stoichiometry of a reaction if we know the \namounts of each reactant that exactly react together and \nthe amounts of each product formed.\nFor example, if we react 4.0 g of hydrogen with 32.0 g of \noxygen we get 36.0 g of water. (Ar values: H = 1.0, O = 16.0)\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nhydrogen (H2)  +  \toxygen (O2)  \n  \twater (H2O)\n​  4.0 \n______ \n2 × 1.0 ​\t\n​  32.0 \n_______ \n2 × 16.0 ​\t\n​ \n36.0 \n_____________ \n \n(2 × 1.0) + 16.0\n ​\t\n= 2 mol\t\n= 1 mol\t\n= 2 mol\nThis ratio is the ratio of stoichiometric numbers in the \nequation. So the equation is:\n2H2  +  O2  \n  2H2O\nWe can still deduce the stoichiometry of this reaction \neven if we do not know the mass of oxygen that reacted. \nThe ratio of hydrogen to water is 1 : 1. But there is only one \natom of oxygen in a molecule of water – half the amount \nin an oxygen molecule. So the mole ratio of oxygen to \nwater in the equation must be 1 : 2.\nQuestion\n6\t \u000756.2 g of silicon, Si, reacts exactly with 284.0 g of \nchlorine, Cl2, to form 340.2 g of silicon(IV) chloride, \nSiCl4. Use this information to calculate the \nstoichiometry of the reaction.\n\u0007(Ar values: Cl = 35.5, Si = 28.1)\n8\nSignificant figures\nWhen we perform chemical calculations it is important \nthat we give the answer to the number of significant \nfigures that fits with the data provided. The examples show \nthe number 526.84 rounded up to varying numbers of \nsignificant figures.\nrounded to 4 significant figures = 526.8\nrounded to 3 significant figures = 527\nrounded to 2 significant figures = 530\nWhen you are writing an answer to a calculation, the \nanswer should be to the same number of significant figures \nas the least number of significant figures in the data.\nworked example\n5\t How many moles of calcium oxide are there in 2.9 g of \ncalcium oxide?\n(Ar values: Ca = 40.1, O = 16.0)\nIf you divide 2.9 by 56.1, your calculator shows \n0.051 693 …. The least number of significant figures \nin the data, however, is 2 (the mass is 2.9 g). So your \nanswer should be expressed to 2 significant figures,  \nas 0.052 mol.\n\nworked example (continued)\nNote 1  Zeros before a number are not significant \nfigures. For example, 0.004 is only to 1 significant \nfigure.\nNote 2  After the decimal point, zeros after a number \nare significant figures. 0.0040 has 2 significant figures \nand 0.004 00 has 3 significant figures.\nNote 3  If you are performing a calculation with \nseveral steps, do not round up in between steps. \nRound up at the end.\nPercentage composition by mass\nWe can use the formula of a compound and relative atomic \nmasses to calculate the percentage by mass of a particular \nelement in a compound.\n% by mass\natomic mass × number of moles of particular\n=  ​             element in a compound             \n \n \n \n______________________________________ \n \n \nmolar mass of compound \n​  × 100\nworked example\n6\t Calculate the percentage by mass of iron in iron(III) \noxide, Fe2O3.\n(Ar values: Fe = 55.8, O = 16.0)\n% mass of iron\t= ​ \n2 × 55.8 \n \n__________________ \n \n(2 × 55.8) + (3 × 16.0) ​ × 100\n= 69.9 %\nFigure 1.10  This iron ore is impure Fe2O3.

For some compounds this can be done by \ncombustion. An organic compound must be very pure in \norder to calculate its empirical formula.

The molecular \nformula is more useful than the empirical formula. We \nuse the molecular formula to write balanced equations \nand to calculate molar masses. The molecular formula is \nalways a multiple of the empirical formula. For example, \nthe molecular formula of ethane, C2H6, is two times the \nempirical formula, CH3.\nIn order to deduce the molecular formula we need  \nto know:\n■\n■\nthe relative formula mass of the compound\n■\n■\nthe empirical formula.\nworked example\n10\t A compound has the empirical formula CH2Br.

The formula of an ionic compound is determined by \nthe charges on each of the ions present. The number of positive \ncharges is balanced by the number of negative charges so that \nthe total charge on the compound is zero. We can work out the \nformula for a compound if we know the charges on the ions. \nFigure 1.11 shows the charges on some simple ions related to \nthe position of the elements in the Periodic Table. The form \nof the Periodic Table that we shall be using has 18 groups \nbecause the transition elements are numbered as Groups \n3 to 12. So, aluminium is in Group 13 and chlorine is in \nGroup 17.\nFor simple metal ions in Groups 1 and 2, the value of \nthe positive charge is the same as the group number. For \na simple metal ion in Group 13, the value of the positive \ncharge is 3+. For a simple non-metal ion in Groups 15 to \n17, the value of the negative charge is 18 minus the group\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n18\nGroup\nnone\nH+\n1\n2\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\nO2–\nF–\nLi+\nBe2+\nnone\nS2–\nAl3+\nCl–\nMg2+\nNa+\nnone\nBr–\nK+\nCa2+\nnone\nGa3+\ntransition\nelements\nI–\nRb+\nSr2+\nnone\nFigure 1.11  The charge on some simple ions is related to \ntheir position in the Periodic Table.\nnumber.

In general, \ncarbon atoms form four bonds with other atoms, hydrogen \nand halogen atoms form one bond and oxygen atoms form \ntwo bonds. So the formula of water, H2O, follows these \nrules. The formula for methane is CH4, with each carbon \natom bonding with four hydrogen atoms.

So there must be the same number of each \ntype of atom on the reactants side of a chemical equation \nas there are on the products side. A symbol equation is a \nshorthand way of describing a chemical reaction. It shows \nthe number and type of the atoms in the reactants and the \nnumber and type of atoms in the products. If these are \nthe same, we say the equation is balanced. Follow these \nexamples to see how we balance an equation.\nworked examples\n13\t Balancing an equation\nStep 1  Write down the formulae of all the reactants and \nproducts.
