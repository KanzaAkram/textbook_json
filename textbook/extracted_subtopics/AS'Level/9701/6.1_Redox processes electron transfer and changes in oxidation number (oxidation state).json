Rusting is an oxidation \nreaction that destroys about 20% of iron and steel \nevery year. Rust is hydrated iron(III) oxide. This forms \nwhen iron reacts with oxygen in the presence of water.\nAnother costly example of oxidation is the reaction \nbetween hydrogen and oxygen that is used to propel \nsome types of rockets into space. In this reaction, the \nhydrogen is oxidised – but the oxygen is also reduced. \nIn fact, oxidation and reduction always take place \ntogether, in what we call redox reactions.\nFigure 7.1  A redox reaction is taking place when the fuel in \nthe Space Shuttle’s rockets burns.\nWhat is a redox reaction?\nA simple definition of oxidation is gain of oxygen by \nan element. For example, when magnesium reacts with \noxygen, the magnesium combines with oxygen to form \nmagnesium oxide. Magnesium has been oxidised.\n2Mg(s)  +  O2(g)  \n  2MgO(s)\nA simple definition of reduction is loss of oxygen. When \ncopper(II) oxide reacts with hydrogen, this is the equation \nfor the reaction:\nCuO(s)  +  H2(g)  \n  Cu(s)  +  H2O(l)\nCopper(II) oxide loses its oxygen. Copper(II) oxide has \nbeen reduced.\nBut if we look carefully at the copper oxide/hydrogen \nequation, we can see that oxidation is also taking place. \nThe hydrogen is gaining oxygen to form water. The \nhydrogen has been oxidised. We can see that reduction \nand oxidation have taken place together.\nOxidation and reduction always take place together. \nWe call the reactions in which this happens redox \nreactions. Redox reactions are very important. For \nexample, one redox reaction – photosynthesis – provides \nfood for the entire planet, and another one – respiration – \nkeeps you alive. both are redox reactions.\n\nChapter 7: Redox reactions\n107\nWe can also define reduction as addition of hydrogen to \na compound and oxidation as removal of hydrogen from \na compound. This is often seen in the reaction of organic \ncompounds (see page 237).\nThere are two other ways of finding out whether or \nnot a substance has been oxidised or reduced during a \nchemical reaction:\n■\n■\nelectron transfer\n■\n■\nchanges in oxidation number.\nQuestion\n1\t \u0007a\t \u0007In each of the following equations, state which \nreactant has been oxidised:\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007PbO  +  H2  \n  Pb  +  H2O\n\u0007ii\t \u0007CO  +  Ag2O  \n  2Ag  +  CO2\n\t\n\t\n\u0007iii\t \u00072Mg  +   CO2  \n  2MgO  +  C\n\u0007b\t \u0007In each of the following equations, state which \nreactant has been reduced:\n\u0007i\t\n\u00075CO  +  I2O2  \n  5CO2  +  I2\n\t\n\t\n\u0007ii\t \u00072H2S  +  SO2  \n  3S  +  2H2O\n\u0007iii\t \u0007CH2   CH2  +  H2  \n  CH3CH3\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nRedox and electron transfer\nHalf-equations\nWe can extend our definition of redox to include reactions \ninvolving ions.\nOxidation Is Loss of electrons.\nReduction Is Gain of electrons.\nThe initial letters shown in bold spell OIL RIG. This may \nhelp you to remember these two definitions!\nSodium reacts with chlorine to form the ionic compound \nsodium chloride.\n2Na(s)  +  Cl2(g)  \n  2NaCl(s)\nWe can divide this reaction into two separate equations, \none showing oxidation and the other showing reduction. \nWe call these half-equations.\nWhen sodium reacts with chlorine:\n■\n■\nEach sodium atom loses one electron from its outer shell. \nOxidation is loss of electrons (OIL). The sodium atoms have \nbeen oxidised.\n108\nNa  \n  Na+  +  e–\nThis half-equation shows that sodium is oxidised.\nIt is also acceptable to write this half-equation as:\nNa – e–  \n  Na+\n■\n■\nEach chlorine atom gains one electron to complete its outer \nshell. Reduction is gain of electrons (RIG). The chlorine \natoms have been reduced.\nCl2  +  2e–  \n  2Cl–\nThis is a half-equation showing chlorine being reduced. \nThere are two chlorine atoms in a chlorine molecule, so \ntwo electrons are gained.\nIn another example iron reacts with copper(II) ions, \nCu2+, in solution to form iron(II) ions, Fe2+, and copper.\nFe(s)  +  Cu2+(aq)  \n  Fe2+(aq)  +  Cu(s)\n■\n■\nEach iron atom loses two electrons to form an Fe2+ ion.

The copper ions \nhave been reduced.\nCu2+ + 2e–  \n  Cu\nBalancing half-equations\nWe can construct a balanced ionic equation from two half-\nequations by balancing the numbers of electrons lost and \ngained and then adding the two half-equations together. \nThe numbers of electrons lost and gained in a redox \nreaction must be equal.\nworked examples\n1\t Construct the balanced ionic equation for the reaction \nbetween nickel and iron(III) ions, Fe3+, from the half-\nequations:\nNi(s)  \n  Ni2+(aq)  +  2e–\nFe3+(aq)  +  e–  \n  Fe2+(aq)\n■\n■\nEach Ni atom loses two electrons when it is \noxidised.

Use the following \ntwo half-equations to help you:\ni\t\n2I–(aq)  \n  I2(aq)  +  2e–\nii\t MnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–  \n  Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\n■\n■\nWhen two iodide ions are oxidised, they lose two \nelectrons. Each MnO4\n– ion gains five electrons when \nit is reduced.\n■\n■\nSo we must multiply equation i by 5 and equation  \nii by 2 to balance the number of electrons:\n10I–(aq)  \n  5I2(aq)  +  10e–\n2MnO4\n–(aq) + 16H+(aq) + 10e– \n 2Mn2+(aq) + 8H2O(l)\n■\n■\nThe balanced ionic equation is:\n2MnO4\n–(aq)  +  10I–(aq)  +  16H+(aq)\n2Mn2+(aq)  +  5I2(aq)  +  8H2O\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nQuestion\n2\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write two half-equations for the following \nreactions.

We do this by using oxidation numbers \n(oxidation numbers are also called oxidation states). An \noxidation number is a number given to each atom or ion in a \ncompound that shows us its degree of oxidation. Oxidation \nnumbers can be positive, negative or zero. The + or – sign must \nalways be included. Higher positive oxidation numbers mean \nthat an atom or ion is more oxidised. Higher negative oxidation \nnumbers mean that an atom or ion is more reduced.\nOxidation number rules\nWe can deduce the oxidation number of any atom or  \nion by using oxidation number rules. It is important to  \nnote that an oxidation number refers to a single atom in  \na compound.\n1\t The oxidation number of any uncombined element is \nzero. For example, the oxidation number of each atom \nin S8, Cl2 and Zn is zero.\n2\t In compounds many atoms or ions have fixed \noxidation numbers\n–\t Group 1 elements are always +1\n–\t Group 2 elements are always +2\n–\t fluorine is always –1\n–\t hydrogen is +1 (except in metal hydrides such as \nNaH, where it is –1)\n–\t oxygen is –2 (except in peroxides, where it is –1, and \nin F2O, where it is +2).\n3\t The oxidation number of an element in a monatomic \nion is always the same as the charge. For example,  \nCl– is –1, Al3+ is +3.\n\nChapter 7: Redox reactions\n4\t The sum of the oxidation numbers in a compound  \nis zero.\n5\t The sum of the oxidation numbers in an ion is equal to \nthe charge on the ion.\n6\t In either a compound or an ion, the more \nelectronegative element is given the negative  \noxidation number.\nFigure 7.2  This is part of a ship’s hull. It is made of iron \nprotected by bars of magnesium metal. The magnesium \natoms (oxidation number = 0) are oxidised to Mg2+ ions \n(oxidation number = +2) in preference to iron atoms changing \nto Fe3+. This is called sacrificial protection.\n109\nApplying the oxidation number rules\nIn the following examples we shall use ‘ox. no.’ as an \nabbreviation for oxidation number.\nCompounds of a metal with a non-metal\nThe metal always has the positive ox. no. and the non-\nmetal has the negative ox. no. For example in sodium \noxide, Na2O, Na = +1 and O = –2.\nIf we do not know the ox. no. of one of the atoms, we \ncan often work it out using the invariable ox. nos. in rule 2. \nFor example in sodium sulfide:\n■\n■\nox. no. of each Na atom = +1\n■\n■\nfor two sodium atoms = +2\n■\n■\nNa2S has no overall charge, so the total ox. no. is zero  \n(rule 4)\n■\n■\nox. no. of S = –2.\nCompounds of a non-metal with a non-metal\nIn compounds containing two different non-metals, the \nsign of the ox. no. depends on the electronegativity of each \natom (see page 157). The most electronegative element is \ngiven the negative sign (rule 6).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nSulfur dioxide, SO2\n■\n■\nox. no. of each O atom = –2\n■\n■\nfor two oxygen atoms = 2 × (–2) = –4\n■\n■\nSO2 has no charge, so the total ox. no. is zero (rule 4)\n■\n■\nox. no. of S = +4\nIodine trichloride, ICl3\n■\n■\nchlorine is more electronegative than iodine, so chlorine is – \nand iodine is +\n■\n■\nox. no. of each Cl atom = –1\n■\n■\nfor three chlorine atoms = 3 × (–1) = –3\n■\n■\nICl3 has no charge, so the total ox. no. is zero (rule 4)\n■\n■\nox. no. of I = +3\nHydrazine, N2H4\n■\n■\nnitrogen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so nitrogen \nis – and hydrogen is +\n■\n■\nox. no. of each H atom = +1 (rule 2)\n■\n■\nfor four hydrogen atoms = 4 × (+1) = +4\n■\n■\nN2H4 has no charge, so the total ox. no. is zero (rule 4)\n■\n■\nox. no. of two N atoms = –4\n■\n■\nox. no. of each N atom = –2\nCompound ions\nCompound ions are ions with two or more different atoms. \nExamples are the sulfate ion, SO4\n2–, and the nitrate ion, \nNO3\n–. We use rule 5 to work out the ox. no. that we do  \nnot know.\nNitrate ion, NO3\n–\n110\n■\n■\nox. no. of each O atom = –2\n■\n■\nfor three oxygen atoms = 3 × (–2) = –6\n■\n■\nNO3\n– has a charge of 1–, so the total ox. no. of N and O atoms \nis –1 (rule 5)\n■\n■\nox. no. of the nitrogen atom plus ox. no. of the three oxygen \natoms (–6) = –1\n■\n■\nox. no. of N = +5\nQuestion\n3\t \u0007State the ox. no. of the bold atoms in these \ncompounds or ions:\n\u0007a\t \u0007P2O5\t\n\u0007e\t \u0007NH3\n\t\n\u0007b\t \u0007SO4\n2–\t\n\u0007f\t\n\u0007ClO2\n–\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007H2S\t\n\u0007g\t \u0007CaCO3\n\t\n\u0007d\t \u0007Al2Cl6\n\nRedox and oxidation number\nWe can define oxidation and reduction in terms of the \noxidation number changes of particular atoms during  \na reaction.\nOxidation is an increase of oxidation number.\nReduction is a decrease in oxidation number.\nFor example, when tin reacts with nitric acid, the \noxidation numbers of each atom of tin and nitrogen \nchange as shown below.\nreduction\nSn + 4HNO3 → SnO2 + 4NO2 + 2H2O\noxidation numbers\n0\n+5\n+4\n+4\noxidation\nFigure 7.3  Copper reacts with silver nitrate to form silver and \ncopper(II) nitrate. The ox. no. of each copper atom has increased \nby two. The ox. no. of each silver ion decreases by one.\nEach tin atom (Sn) has increased in ox. no. by +4: tin \nhas been oxidised. Each nitrogen atom has decreased in \nox. no. by –1: nitrogen has been reduced. The ox. no. of \neach oxygen atom is unchanged at –2. The ox. no. of each \nhydrogen atom is unchanged at +1. Oxygen and hydrogen \nare neither oxidised nor reduced.\nIn this reaction nitric acid is acting as an oxidising agent:\n■\n■\noxidising agents increase the ox. no. of another atom\n■\n■\nan atom in the oxidising agent decreases in ox. no.\n■\n■\nthe oxidising agent is the substance which gets reduced – it \ngains electrons.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nIn this reaction tin is acting as a reducing agent:\n■\n■\nreducing agents decrease the ox. no. of another atom\n■\n■\nan atom in the reducing agent increases in ox. no.\n■\n■\nthe reducing agent is the substance that gets oxidised – it \nloses electrons.\nQuestion\n4\t \u0007a\t \u0007Deduce the change in ox. no. for the bold atoms or \nions in each of the following equations.

We use these systematic names to distinguish \ndifferent compounds made of the same elements. For \nexample, there are two types of iron chloride. We show the \ndifference by naming them iron(II) chloride and iron(III) \nchloride. The numbers in brackets are the oxidation \nnumbers of the iron.\n■\n■\nIn iron(II) chloride, the ox. no. of the iron is +2. The \ncompound contains Fe2+ ions. The formula is FeCl2.\n■\n■\nIn iron(III) chloride, the ox. no. of the iron is +3. The \ncompound contains Fe3+ ions. The formula is FeCl3.\nWe can also use oxidation numbers to distinguish between \nnon-metal atoms in molecules and ions.\nOxides of nitrogen\nThere are several oxides of nitrogen, including N2O, NO \nand NO2. We distinguish between these according to the \nox. no. of the nitrogen atom. (The ox. no. of oxygen is \ngenerally –2.)\n■\n■\nThe ox. no. of N in N2O is +1. So this compound is  \nnitrogen(I) oxide.\n■\n■\nThe ox. no. of N in NO is +2. So this compound is  \nnitrogen(II) oxide.\n■\n■\nThe ox. no. of N in NO2 is +4. So this compound is \nnitrogen(IV) oxide.\n\nChapter 7: Redox reactions\nNitrate ions\nSodium, nitrogen and oxygen can form two different \ncompounds Na+NO2\n– and Na+NO3\n– (Figure 7.4). The ox. \nno. of sodium is +1 and the ox. no. of oxygen is –2. So it is \nthe ox. no. of nitrogen that varies.\n■\n■\nThe ox. no. of N in the NO2\n– ion is +3. So NaNO2 is sodium \nnitrate(III).\n■\n■\nThe ox. no. of N in the NO3\n– ion is +5. So NaNO3 is sodium \nnitrate(V).\nNote that the ox. no. comes after the ion it refers to.\nIons containing oxygen and one other element have the \nending -ate (but hydroxide ions, OH–, are an exception to \nthis rule). For example, ions containing chlorine and  \noxygen are chlorates and ions containing sulfur and \noxygen are sulfates.\nThe names of inorganic acids containing oxygen end \nin –ic. The Roman number goes directly after the ion that \ncontains the oxygen and another element.\n■\n■\nH3PO3 is phosphoric(III) acid because the ox. no. of \nphosphorus is +3.\n■\n■\nHClO4 is chloric(VII) acid because the ox. no. of chlorine is +7.\na\n–\n111\nO\nNa+\nN\nO\nb\n–\nO\nO\nNa+\nN\nO\nFigure 7.4  a  One formula unit of ‘sodium nitrate(III)’ and \nb  one formula unit of ‘sodium nitrate(V)’.\nSalts of the common acids are usually named without \nincluding the ox. no. of the non-metal ion. For example, \nMg(NO3)2 is magnesium nitrate not magnesium nitrate(V) \nand K2SO4 is potassium sulfate not potassium sulfate(VI). \nNote also that we do not state the ox. no. of the metal if it \nhas only one oxidation state.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International AS Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n5\t \u0007Give the full systematic names of the following:\n\u0007a\t \u0007Na2SO3\t\n\u0007e\t \u0007FeSO4\n\t\n\u0007b\t \u0007Na2SO4\t\n\u0007f\t\n\u0007Cu2O\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Fe(NO3)2\t\n\u0007g\t \u0007H2SO3\n\t\n\u0007d\t \u0007Fe(NO3)3\t\n\u0007h\t \u0007Mn2O7\nFrom name to formula\nYou can work out the formula of a compound from  \nits name.\nworked example\n3\t Each formula unit of sodium chlorate(V) contains \none sodium ion.
