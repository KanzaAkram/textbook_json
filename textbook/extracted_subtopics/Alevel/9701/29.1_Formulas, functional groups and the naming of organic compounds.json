Within a class of \ncompounds all the compounds consist of molecules \nwith a particular atom, or grouping of atoms, called \na functional group. Different classes of compounds \nhave different functional groups. The functional group \ndetermines the characteristic chemical properties of the \ncompounds that contain that specific functional group. \nThe functional group in an alkene is the C   C double \nbond. The functional group in a carboxylic acid is the\nCOOH group.\nThe general formula of the class of compounds is given \nin Table 14.2. By substituting a number for n in the general \nformula you get the molecular formula of a particular \ncompound containing that functional group. Note that \nthis formula assumes there is just one functional group \npresent in the molecule.\nNaming organic compounds\nChemists have a system of naming organic compounds \nthat can be applied consistently. This means that they can \ncommunicate with each other clearly when referring to \norganic compounds.\nThe class of hydrocarbons called alkanes provide \nthe basis of the naming system. The stem of each name \nindicates how many carbon atoms are in the longest \nchain in one molecule of the compound. Table 14.3 shows \nthe names of the first ten alkanes and the stems used in \nnaming other molecules.\n192\nNumber \nof carbon \natoms\nMolecular formula \nof straight-chain \nalkane\nName of \nalkane\nStem used \nin naming\n1\nCH4\nmethane\nmeth-\n2\nC2H6\nethane\neth-\n3\nC3H8\npropane\nprop-\n4\nC4H10\nbutane\nbut-\n5\nC5H12\npentane\npent-\n6\nC6H14\nhexane\nhex-\n7\nC7H16\nheptane\nhept-\n8\nC8H18\noctane\noct-\n9\nC9H20\nnonane\nnon-\n10\nC10H22\ndecane\ndec-\nTable 14.3  The stems used in naming simple organic \ncompounds that contain a hydrocarbon chain.\n\nThe position of side-chains or functional groups is \nindicated by numbering the carbon atoms in the longest \nchain. The numbering starts at the end that produces the \nlowest possible numbers in the name (Figure 14.8).\nCH3CHCH2CH2CH3\n|\nCH3\nFigure 14.8  This is called 2-methylpentane, not \n4-methylpentane.\nNote that the hydrocarbon side-chain is named by adding \n–yl to the normal alkane stem, in this case a methyl group. \nThis type of group is called an alkyl group. If there is more \nthan one of the same alkyl side-chain or functional group \nwe indicate how many by inserting di (for two), tri (for \nthree) or tetra (for four) in front of its name. Figure 14.9 \nshows an example.\nCH3\nCH3C\nCHCH2CH3\nCH3\nCH3\nFigure 14.9  This is 2,2,3-trimethylpentane.\nNote that adjacent numbers in a name have a comma \nbetween them, whereas numbers and words are separated \nby hyphens.\nIf there is more than one type of alkyl side-chain, they \nare listed in the name in alphabetical order (Figure 14.10). \nThe alkyl groups appear in its name in alphabetical order.\nCH2CH3\nCH3CHCHCH2CH3\nCH3\nFigure 14.10  This is 3-ethyl-2-methylpentane.\nQuestion\n4\t a\t \u0007Draw the displayed formula of:\ni\t\n\u00072-methylbutane\nii\t \u00073,5-diethylheptane\niii\t \u00072,4,6-trimethyloctane.\nb\t \u0007What is the name of the  \nfollowing hydrocarbon?\nCH3\nCH3CH2CCH2CH2CH2CH3\nCH2CH3\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nIn Table 14.2 we saw the names of compounds with \ncommon functional groups. We also use the numbering \nsystem where necessary to indicate the position of the \nfunctional group in a molecule. For some functional \ngroups no number is needed because the group can \nonly be positioned at the end of a chain. Examples of \nthis include carboxylic acids, such as butanoic acid, and \naldehydes, such as pentanal.\nAs well as alkyl groups, you also have to recognise aryl \ngroups. Aryl compounds contain at least one benzene ring. \nA benzene molecule has six carbon atoms arranged in a \nhexagon, with each carbon atom bonded to one hydrogen \natom. Figure 14.11 shows the displayed and skeletal \nformulae of benzene.\nH\nH\nH\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\ndisplayed formula\nskeletal formula\nFigure 14.11  Ways of representing benzene.\nIf only one alkyl group is bonded to a benzene ring, we do \nnot have to include a number in the name as all six carbon \natoms in the ring are equivalent. However, at A level, you \nwill learn that with two or more alkyl groups we need to \nindicate their positions, as shown in Figure 14.12. (You do \nnot need to recall this numbering for AS level.)\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nmethylbenzene\n1,2-dimethylbenzene\n1,4-dimethylbenzene\nFigure 14.12  Naming aryl compounds.\nQuestion\n5\t Draw the displayed formula of:\na\t \u0007propylbenzene\nb\t \u00071-ethyl-4-methylbenzene\nc\t\n\u00071,3,5-triethylbenzene,\n\u0007using the skeletal formula of benzene in the \nformulae as shown in Figure 14.11.\n\nChapter 14: Introduction to organic chemistry\nBonding in organic molecules\nThe ability of a carbon atom to bond to other carbon \natoms, and the shapes of the molecules formed, can be \nexplained by looking closely at the bonding involved.\nSigma (σ) bonds\nEach carbon atom has six electrons, with an electronic \nconfiguration of 1s22s22p2. This means that carbon has \nfour electrons in its outermost shell. By forming single \ncovalent bonds with four other atoms, a carbon atom can \ngain the electronic configuration of the noble gas neon \n(see page 49). These single covalent bonds are known as \nsigma (σ) bonds.\nThe pair of electrons in a σ bond is found in a region of \nspace (described as a lobe) between the nuclei of the two \natoms sharing the electrons. The electrostatic attraction \nbetween the negatively charged electrons and the two \npositively charged nuclei bonds the atoms to each other \n(see page 51).\nIn many organic compounds each carbon atom \nforms four σ bonds. The four bonding pairs of electrons \naround each carbon atom repel each other. They position \nthemselves in a tetrahedral arrangement to get as far apart \nfrom each other as possible. The tetrahedral bond angle \nis 109.5° (see page 55). Figure 14.13 shows the shape of an \nethane molecule.\n193\nH\nH\nH\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nFigure 14.13  The bond angles are all close to 109.5° in an \nethane molecule. The two carbon atoms, each forming four \nsigma bonds, are said to be sp3 hybridised (see page 57).\nPi (π) bonds\nCarbon can also form double bonds between its atoms in \norganic molecules, as well as forming single bonds. A  \nC   C double bond, as found in alkenes such as ethene, is \nmade up of a σ bond and a pi (π) bond. The carbon atoms \ninvolved in the double bond will each form three  σ bonds; \nan example of sp2 hybridisation (see page 57). This leaves \neach carbon atom with one spare outer electron in a 2p \norbital. When these two p orbitals overlap they form a  \nπ bond. Figure 14.14 shows how the π bond is formed  \nin ethene.\nThe two lobes that make up the π bond lie above and \nbelow the plane of the atoms in an ethene molecule. This",
