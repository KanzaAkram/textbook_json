For \nexample, aqueous hydrochloric acid consists entirely \nof H3O+(aq) and Cl–(aq):\nHCl(g)  +  H2O(l)  \n  H3O+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\n■\n■\nWeak acids only ionise to a small extent in water.\nFor example, aqueous ethanoic acid consists mostly of \nun-ionised CH3COOH(aq):\nCH3COOH(aq)  +  H2O(l)  \n  CH3COO–(aq)  +  H3O+(aq)\nThe pH of the resulting solutions can be related to the \nconcentration of H3O+ ions formed.\nIn this chapter:\n■\n■\nwe shall use hydrogen ion concentrations to \ncalculate pH values for solutions of strong acids\n■\n■\nwe shall use equilibrium expressions to calculate \nhydrogen ion concentrations for solutions of weak \nacids, in order to calculate their pH values\n■\n■\nwe shall also learn about ionic equilibria related to \nthe solubility of salts.\n304\nThe ionic product of water, Kw\nWater is able to act as either an acid (by donating protons, \nH+) or a base (by accepting protons). In pure water, the \nfollowing equilibrium exists.\nH+ donated\nH2O(l)  +  H2O(l)  \n  H3O+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\n\t\nacid\t\nbase\nWe can simplify this equation by writing hydroxonium \nions, H3O+, as simple hydrogen ions, H+:\nH2O(l)  \n  H+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nThe equilibrium expression for this reaction is:\nKc = ​ [H+(aq)] [OH–(aq)] \n \n________________ \n \n[H2O(l)] \n​\nThe extent of ionisation of water is very low. The concentration \nof hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions in pure water (and  \nhence the value of Kc) is extremely small. Because of this, \nwe can regard the concentration of water as being constant.\n\nFigure 21.1  Compost in a compost bin. The pH of compost \nchanges as the plant material is broken down by bacterial \naction. The chemical reactions in compost involve weak acids \nand weak bases.\nWe can therefore incorporate this into the value of Kc. The \nequilibrium expression then becomes:\nKw = [H+] [OH–]\nKw is called the ionic product of water. Its value at 298 K is \n1.00 × 10–14 mol2 dm–6.\nWe can use this equation to find the hydrogen ion \nconcentration in pure water; for simplicity we will now \nomit the state symbol (aq). For each molecule of water that \nionises, one H+ ion and one OH– ion are produced.\n[H+] = [OH–]\nWe can rewrite the equilibrium expression\nKw = [H+] [OH–]\nas:\nKw = [H+]2\nRearranging this equation to find the hydrogen ion \nconcentration [H+] in pure water:\nKw ​ = ​√ \n__________ \n1.00 × 10–14 ​ = 1.00 × 10–7 mol dm–3\n[H+] = ​√ \n___\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\npH calculations\nWe know that the lower the hydrogen ion concentration, \nthe higher the pH. The pH values of some familiar aqueous \nsolutions are shown in Table 21.1.\nThe range of possible hydrogen ion concentrations  \nin different solutions is very large. It can range from  \n10–15 mol dm–3 to 10 mol dm–3. In order to overcome the \nproblem of dealing with a wide range of numbers, the Danish \nchemist Søren Sørensen introduced the pH scale.\nSolution\npH\nhydrochloric acid (1.00 mol dm–3)\n0.0\nstomach ‘juices’ (contains HCl(aq))\n1.0–2.0\nlemon juice\n2.3\nvinegar\n3\ncoffee\naround 5\nrainwater (normal)\n5.7\nsaliva\n6.3–6.8\nfresh milk\naround 6.5\npure water\n7.0\nsea water\naround 8.5\nmilk of magnesia\n10\nsoapy water (cheap soap!)\n11\nbench sodium hydroxide (1.00 mol dm–3)\n14\nTable 21.1  pH values of some familiar aqueous solutions.\npH is defined as the negative logarithm to the base 10 of \nthe hydrogen ion concentration.

They each have a small \nconcentration of H+ ions because H2O \n H+  +  OH– is \nan equilibrium. Even when there is an excess of OH– ions \nthere is still a small concentration of H+ ions. In the same \nway, the solutions in question 1, parts a and b, have a  \nsmall concentration of OH– ions, even though the \nsolutions are acids.\nCalculating [H+] from pH\nHere is an example of the use of logarithms to calculate \nhydrogen ion concentration from pH.

Strong monobasic acids such as \nhydrochloric acid are completely ionised in solution. It \nfollows from this that the concentration of hydrogen ions \nin solution is approximately the same as the concentration \nof the acid. (We are making the assumption that the \nconcentration of H+ ions arising from the ionisation of \nwater molecules is very small compared with those arising \nfrom the acid.)\nFigure 21.2  A pH electrode allows us to determine  \npH accurately.\n\n■\n■\npH of 0.1 mol dm–3 HCl is –log (1 × 10–1 mol dm–3) = pH 1\n■\n■\npH of 0.01 mol dm–3 HCl is –log (1 × 10–2 mol dm–3) = pH 2\n■\n■\npH of 0.001 mol dm–3 HCl is –log (1 × 10–3 mol dm–3) = pH 3\nDiluting the acid 10 times reduces the value of the H+ ion \nconcentration by one-tenth and increases the pH by a \nvalue of one.\nCalculating the pH of strong bases\nStrong bases, such as sodium hydroxide, ionise completely \nin solution. The concentration of hydroxide ions in a \nsolution of sodium hydroxide is therefore approximately \nthe same as the concentration of the sodium hydroxide.\nTo calculate the pH of a solution of strong base we need \nto know:\n■\n■\nthe concentration of OH– ions in solution\n■\n■\nthe equilibrium expression for the ionisation of water: \n Kw = [H+] [OH–]\n■\n■\nthe value of Kw for water.\nAs Kw = [H+] [OH–]\n[H+] = ​  Kw \n______ \n[OH–] ​\nWe can calculate the [H+] and then calculate the pH.\nworked example\n3\t Calculate the pH of a solution of sodium hydroxide of \nconcentration 0.0500 mol dm–3.\nKw = 1.00 × 10–14 mol2 dm–6 (at 298 K).\nStep 1  Write the expression relating [H+] to Kw and [OH–]\nKw \n_____ \n[OH–] ​\n[H+] = ​\nStep 2  Substitute the values into the expression to \ncalculate [H+].\n[H+] = ​ 1.00 × 10–14 \n__________ \n0.0500  ​ = 2.00 × 10–13 mol dm–3\nStep 3  Calculate the pH.\npH\t = –log10 [H+]\n\t\n= –log10 (2.00 × 10–13)\n\t\n= 12.7\nA quick way to get the same answer is to:\n■\n■\nfind –log10 [OH–] (here –log10 [OH–] = –log10 (0.0500) \n= 1.3).\n■\n■\nsubtract this value from 14 (in this example  \n14 – 1.3 = 12.7).\nThis works because –log10 [H+] – log10 [OH–] = 14.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nQuestion\n3\t Find the pH of the following strong acids and strong \nbases:\na\t 1.00 mol dm–3 HNO3\n\t\nb\t 0.500 mol dm–3 HNO3\n\t\nc\t\nan aqueous solution containing 3.00 g HCl per dm3\nd\t 0.001 00 mol dm–3 KOH \n\t\n(Kw = 1.00 × 10–14 mol2 dm–6)\n\t\ne\t \u0007an aqueous solution containing 0.200 g of NaOH \nper dm3\n(Kw = 1.00 × 10–14 mol2 dm–6)\nWeak acids – using the acid \ndissociation constant, Ka\nKa and pKa\nThe equilibrium law (see page 123) can be applied to \naqueous solutions of weak acids and weak bases. For \nexample, when ethanoic acid dissolves in water the \nfollowing equilibrium results:\nCH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l) \n H3O+(aq) +  CH3COO–(aq)\nWe can simplify this equation to:\nCH3COOH(aq)  \n  H+(aq)  +  CH3COO–(aq)\nethanoic acid\t\nethanoate ion\nThe equilibrium expression for this reaction is:\nKa = ​ [H+] [CH3COO–] \n \n_______________ \n \n[CH3COOH]  ​\nKa is called the acid dissociation constant. At 298 K the \nvalue of Ka for the dissociation of ethanoic acid is  \n1.74 × 10–5 mol dm–3.\nThe units of Ka are determined in the same way as for Kc \n(see page 123). For the dissociation of a monobasic acid the \nunits are mol dm–3.\nWe can write the general formula for a monobasic acid \nas HA. The balanced equation for the partial ionisation of \nthis weak acid is:\nHA(aq)  \n  H+(aq)  +  A–(aq)\nThe general equilibrium expression applying to a \nmonobasic acid then becomes:\nKa = ​ [H+] [A–] \n________ \n[HA]  ​\n\nChapter 21: Further aspects of equilibria\nFigure 21.3  Friedrich Ostwald (1853–1932) was a German \nchemist who developed the idea of ‘degree of dissociation’ \nof weak acids and bases. He was one of the most famous \nphysical chemists of his day. But strangely enough, he didn’t \naccept the atomic theory until 1906.\nThe value of Ka indicates the extent of dissociation of the acid.\n■\n■\nA high value for Ka (for example, 40 mol dm–3) indicates that \nthe position of equilibrium lies to the right. The acid is almost \ncompletely ionised.\n■\n■\nA low value for Ka (for example, 1.0 × 10–4 mol dm–3) indicates \nthat the position of equilibrium lies to the left. The acid is \nonly slightly ionised and exists mainly as HA molecules and \ncomparatively few H+ and A– ions.\n307\nAs Ka values for many acids are very low, we can use  \npKa values to compare their strengths.\npKa = –log10Ka\nTable 21.2 shows the range of values of Ka and pKa for \nvarious acids.

This is reasonable because the ionic product of\n\nwater (1.00 × 10–14 mol2 dm–6) is negligible compared with \nthe values for most weak acids (see Table 21.2).\n■\n■\nWe assume that the ionisation of the weak acid is so small \nthat the concentration of undissociated HA molecules \npresent at equilibrium is approximately the same as that of \nthe original acid.\nWorked example 4 shows how to calculate the value of Ka \nusing the pH and the concentration of the weak acid.\nworked example\n4\t Calculate the value of Ka for methanoic acid.

A buffer solution is used to keep pH \n(almost) constant.\nOne type of buffer solution is a mixture of a weak acid \nand one of its salts. An example is an aqueous mixture of \nethanoic acid and sodium ethanoate. Mixtures of ethanoic \nacid and sodium ethanoate in different proportions act as \nbuffers between pH values of 4 and 7. We can understand \nhow a buffer solution works by referring to the equilibria \ninvolved.\nEthanoic acid is a weak acid. So it stays mostly in the \nun-ionised form (CH3COOH) and only gives rise to a low \nconcentration of ethanoate ions in solution:\nCH3COOH(aq)  \n  H+(aq)  +  CH3COO–(aq)\nethanoic acid\t\nethanoate ion\n\nChapter 21: Further aspects of equilibria\nFigure 21.12  The pH of this agar plate for growing bacteria is \nkept constant by using a buffer solution. The buffer solution is \nincorporated in the agar jelly used to make the plate.\nSodium ethanoate is fully ionised in aqueous solution:\nCH3COONa(s)  +  aq  \n  Na+(aq)  +  CH3COO–(aq)\nsodium ethanoate\t\nethanoate ion\nThe buffer solution contains relatively high concentrations \nof both CH3COOH and CH3COO–. We say that there are \nreserve supplies of the acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate \nbase (CH3COO–). The pH of a buffer solution depends \non the ratio of the concentration of the acid and the \nconcentration of its conjugate base. If this does not change \nvery much, the pH changes very little.\nIn the buffer solution ethanoic acid molecules are in \nequilibrium with hydrogen ions and ethanoate ions:\n313\nCH3COOH(aq)  \n  H+(aq)  +  CH3COO–(aq)\nrelatively high\t\nrelatively high \n\t\nconcentration\t\nconcentration \n\t\nof ethanoic acid\t\nof ethanoate ions\nWe can use this equation to explain how buffer  \nsolutions work.\nAn increase in hydrogen ion concentration would \ngreatly lower the pH of water, but when H+ ions are added \nto the buffer solution:\n■\n■\naddition of H+ ions shifts the position of equilibrium to the \nleft because H+ ions combine with CH3COO– ions to form more \nCH3COOH until equilibrium is re-established\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COO– ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COO– ions in solution does not  \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COOH ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COOH molecules in solution does not \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nso the pH does not change significantly.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nAn increase in hydroxide ion concentration would greatly \nincrease the pH of water, but when OH– ions are added to \nthe buffer solution:\n■\n■\nthe added OH– ions combine with H+ ions to form water\n■\n■\nthis reduces the H+ ion concentration\n■\n■\nthe position of equilibrium shifts to the right\n■\n■\nso CH3COOH molecules ionise to form more H+ and \nCH3COO– ions until equilibrium is re-established\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COOH ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COOH molecules in solution does not \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COO– ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COO– ions in solution does not  \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nso the pH does not change significantly.\nIn unpolluted regions of the Earth, rainwater has a pH \nof 5.7. This is because carbon dioxide dissolves in the \nrainwater to form a dilute solution of the weak acid \ncarbonic acid, H2CO3. This acid and its conjugate base, \nHCO3\n–, act as a buffer solution. It minimises changes in \npH if very small amounts of acid or alkali are added to the \nrainwater. But in regions where there is pollution caused \nby the emission of acidic oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, the \npH of the rainwater falls to around 4. The rainwater can \nno longer act as a buffer because the concentrations of the \nH2CO3 and HCO3\n– are not high enough to cope with the \nlarge amounts of acidic pollution involved.\nNo buffer solution can cope with the excessive addition \nof acids or alkalis. If very large amounts of acid or alkali \nare added, the pH will change significantly.\nBuffer solutions that resist changes in pH in alkaline \nregions are usually a mixture of a weak base and its \nconjugate acid. An example is a mixture of aqueous \nammonia with ammonium chloride.\nAqueous ammonia is a weak base, so there is only a low \nconcentration of ammonium ions in ammonia solution:\n314\nNH3(aq)  +  H2O(l)   \n   NH4\n+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nAmmonium chloride is fully ionised in aqueous  \nsolution.

They are also used to \nmake sure that pH meters record the correct pH.\nMany animals depend on buffers to keep a constant \npH in various parts of their bodies. In humans, the pH \nof the blood is kept between 7.35 and 7.45 by a number of \ndifferent buffers in the blood:\n■\n■\nhydrogencarbonate ions, HCO3\n–\n■\n■\nhaemoglobin and plasma proteins\n■\n■\ndihydrogenphosphate (H2PO4\n–) and hydrogenphosphate \n(HPO4\n2–) ions.\nThe cells in our body produce carbon dioxide as a product \nof aerobic respiration (the oxidation of glucose to provide \nenergy).

When the blood passes through the small \nblood vessels around our lungs hydrogencarbonate ions \nare rapidly converted to carbon dioxide and water. The \ncarbon dioxide escapes into the lungs.\nThe production of H+ ions, if left unchecked, would lower \nthe pH of the blood and cause ‘acidosis’. This may disrupt \nsome body functions and eventually lead to coma. The \nequilibrium between carbon dioxide and hydrogencarbonate \nis the most important buffering system in the blood.\nIf the H+ ion concentration increases:\n■\n■\nthe position of this equilibrium shifts to the left\n■\n■\nH+ ions combine with HCO3\n– ions to form carbon dioxide \nand water until equilibrium is restored\n■\n■\nthis reduces the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood \nand helps keep the pH constant.\nIf the H+ ion concentration decreases:\n■\n■\nthe position of this equilibrium shifts to the right\n■\n■\nsome carbon dioxide and water combine to form H+ and \nHCO3\n– ions until equilibrium is restored\n■\n■\nthis increases the concentration of hydrogen ions in the \nblood and helps keep the pH constant.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n11\t a\t \u0007One of the buffers in blood plasma is a mixture \nof dihydrogenphosphate ions (H2PO4\n–) and \nhydrogenphosphate (HPO4\n2–) ions.\ni\t\n\u0007Identify the conjugate acid and base in  \nthis buffer.\nii\t \u0007Write a balanced equation for the equilibrium \nbetween these two ions.\nb\t \u0007Some proteins in the blood can act as buffers.

Some \nionic compounds, however, are insoluble or only slightly \nsoluble in water. But even ‘insoluble’ ionic compounds \nmay dissolve to a very small extent in water. Solubility \nis generally quoted as the number of grams or number \nof moles of compound needed to saturate 100 g or 1 kg \nof water at a given temperature. We say that a solution is \nsaturated when no more solute dissolves in it.\n316\n■\n■\nSodium chloride is regarded as a soluble salt: a saturated \nsolution contains 36 g per 100 g of water.\n■\n■\nLead(II) chloride is regarded as an insoluble salt: a saturated \nsolution contains 0.99 g per 100 g of water.\nSolubility product\nAn equilibrium is established when an undissolved \nionic compound is in contact with a saturated solution \nof its ions.

Values are quoted  \nat 298 K.\nSolubility product is the product of the concentrations \nof each ion in a saturated solution of a sparingly soluble \nsalt at 298 K, raised to the power of their relative \nconcentrations.\nKsp = [Cy+(aq)]a[Ax–(aq)]b\nwhere a is the number of C y+ cations in one formula unit \nof the compound and b is the number of Ax– anions in one \nformula unit of the compound\nSo for Fe2S3 (which contains Fe3+ ions and S2– ions) the \nequilibrium is:\nFe2S3(s)  \n  2Fe3+(aq)  +  3S2–(aq)\nand the equilibrium expression is:\nKsp = [Fe3+(aq)]2[S2–(aq)]3\nThe idea of solubility product only applies to ionic \ncompounds that are only slightly soluble.\nThe units of solubility product depend on the number \nof each type of ion present in solution. You can work \nthe units out in the same way as for general equilibrium \nexpressions (see page 123), but you don’t have to do any \ncancelling.

For \nexample: will we get a precipitate when we mix a solution \nof barium chloride, BaCl2, with a very dilute solution of \nsodium carbonate?\nBoth barium chloride and sodium carbonate are \nsoluble salts, but barium carbonate is relatively insoluble. \nWe must consider the equilibrium for the insoluble salt \ndissolving in water:\n318\nBaCO3(s)  \n  Ba2+(aq)  +  CO3\n2–(aq)\nThe solubility product is given by:\nKsp = [Ba2+] [CO3\n2–] = 5.5 × 10–10 mol2 dm–6\nIf [Ba2+][CO3\n2–] is greater than 5.5 × 10–10 mol2 dm–6 a \nprecipitate will form.\nIf [Ba2+][CO3\n2–] is less than 5.5 × 10–10 mol2 dm–6 no \nprecipitate will form.\nworked example\n9\t Will a precipitate form if we mix equal volumes of \nsolutions of 1.00 × 10–4 mol dm–3 Na2CO3 and  \n5.00 × 10–5 mol dm–3 BaCl2?\n■\n■\n[Ba2+] = 2.50 × 10–5 mol dm–3\n■\n■\n[CO32–] = 5.00 × 10–5 mol dm–3\n[Ba2+] [CO32–]\t = (2.50 × 10–5) × (5.00 × 10–5)\n\t\n\t\n= 1.25 × 10–9 mol2 dm–6\nThis value is greater than the solubility product, so a \nprecipitate of barium carbonate forms.\n\nFigure 21.15  The shell of this nautilus is composed mainly of \ncalcium carbonate. The nautilus adjusts conditions so shell \nmaterial is formed when the concentration of calcium ions \nand carbonate ions in seawater are high enough to precipitate \ncalcium carbonate.\nThe common ion effect\nThe common ion effect is the reduction in the solubility \nof a dissolved salt achieved by adding a solution of \na compound which has an ion in common with the \ndissolved salt. This often results in precipitation.\nAn example of the common ion effect can be seen when we \nadd a solution of sodium chloride to a saturated solution of \nsilver chloride and silver chloride precipitates. Why is this?\nIn a saturated solution of silver chloride in water, we \nhave the following equilibrium:\nAgCl(s)  \n  Ag+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\nWe now add a solution of sodium chloride:\n■\n■\nthe chloride ion is common to both sodium chloride and \nsilver chloride\n■\n■\nthe added chloride ions shift the position of equilibrium to \nthe left\n■\n■\nsilver chloride is precipitated.\nThe addition of the common ion, Cl–, has reduced the \nsolubility of the silver chloride because its solubility \nproduct has been exceeded. When [Ag+] [Cl–] is greater \nthan the Ksp for silver chloride a precipitate will form.",
