In this \nchapter we show how we can use enthalpy changes \nto calculate the strength of ionic bonding, and \nexplain differences in solubility and ease of thermal \ndecomposition of ionic compounds.\nFigure 19.1  A model of the sodium chloride lattice. The \nenergy released when gaseous ions combine to form a lattice \nis called the lattice energy.\nDefining lattice energy\nWhen ions combine to form an ionic solid there is a huge \nrelease of energy. The reaction is highly exothermic. The \nenergy given out when ions of opposite charges come together \nto form a crystalline lattice is called the lattice energy, ΔH \nO\n—\nlatt.\nEquations describing the lattice energy of sodium \nchloride and magnesium chloride are shown here.\n258\nLattice energy is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of an \nionic compound is formed from its gaseous ions under \nstandard conditions.\nNa+(g) + Cl–(g)  \n  NaCl(s)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nlatt = –787 kJ mol–1\nMg2+(g) + 2Cl–(g)  \n  MgCl2(s)\b ΔH \nO\n—\nlatt = –2526 kJ mol–1\nNote that:\n■\n■\nit is the gaseous ions that combine to form the ionic solid\n■\n■\nthe lattice energy is always exothermic: the value of  \nΔH O\n—\nlatt is always negative, because the definition specifies \nthe bonding together of ions, not the separation of ions.\nThe large exothermic value of the lattice energy shows that \nthe ionic lattice is very stable with respect to its gaseous \nions. The more exothermic the lattice energy, the stronger \nthe ionic bonding in the lattice.\nIt is impossible to determine the lattice energy of a \ncompound by a single direct experiment. We can, however, \ncalculate a value for ΔH \nO\n—\nlatt using several experimental \nvalues and an energy cycle called a Born–Haber cycle. In \norder to do this, we first need to introduce two more types \nof enthalpy change.\n\nNote that the quantity we have defined as lattice energy \nis more accurately called the lattice enthalpy. However, \nthe term lattice energy is commonly applied to lattice \nenthalpy as well. Lattice energy is the internal energy \nchange when 1 mole of an ionic compound is formed from \nits gaseous ions at 0 K. Lattice enthalpy values are very \nclose to the corresponding lattice energy values.\nQuestion\n1\t a\t \u0007Give values for the standard conditions of \ntemperature and pressure.\nb\t Write equations describing the lattice energy of:\ni\t\nmagnesium oxide\nii\t potassium bromide\niii\t sodium sulfide.\nEnthalpy change of atomisation \nand electron affinity\nEnthalpy change of atomisation\nThe standard enthalpy change of atomisation, ΔH O\n—\nat, is \nthe enthalpy change when 1 mole of gaseous atoms is \nformed from its element under standard conditions.\nThe standard enthalpy change of atomisation of lithium \nrelates to the equation:\nLi(s)  \n  Li(g)\t\nΔH \nO\n—\nat  = +161 kJ mol–1\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nThe standard enthalpy change of atomisation of chlorine \nrelates to the equation:\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2(g)  \n  Cl(g)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nat = +122 kJ mol–1\nValues of ΔH \nO\n—\nat are always positive (endothermic) because \nenergy must be supplied to break the bonds holding the \natoms in the element together.\nQuestion\n2\t a\t \u0007The bond energy of the chlorine molecule is \n+244 kJ mol–1. Why is the standard enthalpy \nchange of atomisation half this value?\nb\t \u0007Write equations, including state symbols, that \nrepresent the enthalpy change of atomisation of:\ni\t\noxygen\nii\t barium\niii\t bromine.\nc\t\n\u0007What is the numerical value of the enthalpy change \nof atomisation of helium? Explain your answer.\nElectron affinity\nThe energy change occurring when a gaseous non-metal \natom accepts one electron is called the electron affinity. \nThe symbol for electron affinity is ΔH \nO\n—\nea.\nThe first electron affinity, ΔH O\n—\nea1, is the enthalpy change\nwhen 1 mole of electrons is added to 1 mole of  \ngaseous atoms to form 1 mole of gaseous 1– ions under \nstandard conditions.\nEquations representing the first electron affinity of \nchlorine and sulfur are:\nCl(g)  +  e–  \n  Cl–(g)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nea1 = –348 kJ mol–1\nS(g)  +  e–  \n  S–(g)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nea1 = –200 kJ mol–1\nNote that:\n■\n■\nthe change is from gaseous atoms to gaseous 1– ions\n■\n■\nthe enthalpy change for the first electron affinity, ΔH O\n—\nea1 is \ngenerally exothermic: ΔH O\n—\nea is negative.\nWhen an element forms an ion with more than one \nnegative charge, we must use successive electron affinities \n(this is rather like the successive ionisation energies we \nused on page 34). The 1st, 2nd and 3rd electron affinities \nhave symbols ΔH \nO\n—\nea1, ΔH \nO\n—\nea2 and ΔH \nO\n—\nea3.\n\nChapter 19: Lattice energy\nThe second electron affinity, ΔH O\n—\nea2, is the enthalpy \nchange when 1 mole of electrons is added to 1 mole of \ngaseous 1– ions to form 1 mole of gaseous 2– ions under \nstandard conditions.\nThe equations representing the 1st and 2nd electron \naffinities of oxygen are:\n1st electron affinity: \nO(g)  +  e–  \n  O–(g) ΔH \nO\n—\nea1 = –141 kJ mol–1\n2nd electron affinity: \nO–(g)  +  e–  \n  O2–(g) ΔH \nO\n—\nea2 = +798 kJ mol–1\nNote that 2nd electron affinities are always endothermic \n(ΔH \nO\n—\nea2 is positive), and so are 3rd electron affinities.\nThe overall enthalpy change in forming an oxide ion, \nO2–, from an oxygen atom is found by adding together the \n1st and 2nd electron affinities:\nO(g)  +  2e–  \n  O2–(g)\nΔH \nO\n—\nea1  +  ΔH \nO\n—\nea2 = (–141)  +  (+798) = +657 kJ mol–1\n259\nQuestion\n3\t a\t \u0007Suggest why the 2nd and 3rd electron affinities are \nalways endothermic.\nb\t \u0007The 1st electron affinity of sulfur is –200 kJ mol–1. \nThe second electron affinity of sulfur is \n+640 kJ mol–1. Calculate a value for the enthalpy \nchange S(g)  +  2e– \n S2–(g)\nc\t\nWrite equations representing:\ni\t\nthe 1st electron affinity of iodine\nii\t the 2nd electron affinity of sulfur.\nBorn–Haber cycles\nComponents of the Born–Haber cycle\nWe have seen how we can apply Hess’s law in energy cycles \nto work out enthalpy changes (page 97). A Born–Haber \ncycle is a particular type of enthalpy cycle used to calculate \nlattice energy. In simple terms it can be represented by \nFigure 19.2.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nlattice energy, ∆Hlatt\nions in\ngaseous state\nionic\ncompound\n∆H 1\nstandard \nenthalpy change\nof formation, ∆Hf\nelements in their\nstandard states\nFigure 19.2  A simple enthalpy cycle that can be used to \ncalculate lattice energy.
