It is often used to extract \nmetals that are high in the reactivity series. These metals \ncannot be extracted by heating their ores with carbon. \nElectrolysis is also used to produce non-metals such \nas chlorine and to purify some metals. Electrolysis is \ngenerally carried out in an electrolysis cell (Figure 20.2).\n–\n+\ndirect current\npower supply\ne–\ne–\nnegative \nelectrode\n(cathode)\npositive\n electrode\n(anode)\nelectrodes\nelectrolyte\nFigure 20.2  The main parts of an electrolysis cell. The \nactual structure of the cell will vary according to the element \nextracted. The e– shows the direction of travel of the electrons \naround the external circuit.\nIn the electrolysis cell:\n■\n■\nthe electrolyte is the compound that is decomposed; it is \neither a molten ionic compound or a concentrated aqueous \nsolution of ions\n■\n■\nthe electrodes are rods, made from either carbon  \n(graphite) or metal, which conduct electricity to and  \nfrom the electrolyte\n–\t the anode is the positive electrode\n–\t the cathode is the negative electrode\n■\n■\nthe power supply must be direct current.\nQuestion\n3\t a \t \u0007Why does an ionic compound have to be molten to \nundergo electrolysis?\nb\t \u0007Give two properties of graphite that make it a \nsuitable material for use as an electrode. Explain \nyour answers.\n\nChapter 20: Electrochemistry\nRedox reactions in electrolysis\nDuring electrolysis, the positive ions (cations) move to the \ncathode. When they reach the cathode they gain electrons \nfrom the cathode. For example:\nCu2+  +  2e–  \n  Cu\n2H+  +  2e–  \n  H2\nGain of electrons is reduction. Reduction always occurs \nat the cathode. If metal atoms are formed, they may be \ndeposited as a layer of metal on the cathode. Alternatively \nthey may form a molten layer in the cell. If hydrogen gas is \nformed, it bubbles off.\nThe negative ions (anions) move to the anode. When \nthey reach the anode they lose electrons to the anode.  \nFor example:\n2Cl–  \n  Cl2  +  2e–\n4OH–  \n  O2  +  2H2O  +  4e–\nLoss of electrons is oxidation. Oxidation always occurs at \nthe anode.\nElectrolysis is a redox reaction. For example, when \nmolten zinc chloride is electrolysed the electrode \nreactions are:\n275\ncathode: Zn2+  +  2e–  \n  Zn (reduction)\nanode: 2Cl–  \n  Cl2  +  2e– (oxidation)\nThe electron loss at the anode balances the electron gain at \nthe cathode. Overall, the reaction is:\nZnCl2  \n  Zn  +  Cl2\nQuestion\n4\t a\t \u0007Explain why cations move towards the cathode \nduring electrolysis.\nb\t \u0007When lead iodide, PbI2, is electrolysed the \nfollowing reactions occur:\nPb2+  +  2e–  \n  Pb and 2I–  \n  I2  +  2e–\ni\t\n\u0007Which of these equations describes the \nreaction at the cathode? Explain your answer.\nii\t \u0007What is the ox. no. change of each iodide ion in \nthe reaction\n2I–  \n  I2  +  2e–?\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nQuantitative electrolysis\nThe mass of substance deposited  \nduring electrolysis\nThe mass of a substance produced at an electrode during \nelectrolysis is proportional to:\n■\n■\nthe time over which a constant electric current passes\n■\n■\nthe strength of the electric current.\nCombining current and time, we get the relationship:\ncurrent \n (in amperes, A)\nQ\n=\nI\n×\nt\ncharge\n(in coulombs, C)\ntime\n (in seconds, s)\nThe mass of a substance produced at (or removed from) \nan electrode during electrolysis is proportional to the \nquantity of electricity (in coulombs) which passes through \nthe electrolyte.\nThe quantity of electricity is often expressed in terms \nof a unit called the Faraday (symbol F). 1 Faraday is the \nquantity of electric charge carried by 1 mole of electrons or \n1 mole of singly charged ions. Its value is 96 500 C mol–1  \n(to 3 significant figures).\nDuring the electrolysis of silver nitrate solution, silver \nis deposited at the cathode:\n276\nAg+\t +\t e–\t\n\t\nAg\n\t 1 mol\t\n\t\n1 mol\t\n\t\n1 mol\n1 Faraday of electricity (96 500 C) is required to deposit  \n1 mole of silver.\nDuring the electrolysis of copper(II) sulfate solution, \ncopper is deposited at the cathode:\nCu2+\t +\t 2e–\t\n\t\nCu\n\t1 mol\t\n\t\n2 mol\t\n\t\n 1 mol\nThe equation shows that 2 moles of electrons are needed  \nto produce 1 mole of copper from Cu2+ ions. So it requires \n2 Faradays of electricity (2 × 96 500 C) to deposit 1 mole  \nof copper.\nDuring the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, \nchlorine is produced at the anode:\n2Cl–\t\n\t Cl2\t +\t\n2e–\n2 mol\t\n\t\n1 mol\t\n\t\n2 mol\n\nThe equation shows that 2 moles of electrons are released \nwhen 1 mole of chlorine gas is formed from 2 moles of Cl– \nions. So it requires 2 Faradays of electricity (2 × 96 500 C) \nto produce 1 mole of Cl2.\nDuring the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of \nsulfuric acid or aqueous sodium sulfate, oxygen is \nproduced at the anode:\n4OH–(aq)  \n  O2(g)  +  2H2O(l)  +  4e–\nThe equation shows that 4 moles of electrons are released \nwhen 1 mole of oxygen gas is formed from 4 moles of OH– \nions. So it requires 4 Faradays of electricity (4 × 96 500 C) \nto produce 1 mole of O2.\nCalculating amount of substance \nproduced during electrolysis\nWe can use the value of F to calculate:\n■\n■\nthe mass of substance deposited at an electrode\n■\n■\nthe volume of gas produced at an electrode.\nworked examples\n1\t Calculate the mass of lead deposited at the cathode \nduring electrolysis when a current of 1.50 A flows \nthrough molten lead(II) bromide for 20.0 min. \n(Ar value: [Pb] = 207; F = 96 500 C mol–1)\nStep 1  Write the half-equation for the reaction.\nPb2+  +  2e–  \n  Pb\nStep 2  Find the number of coulombs required to \ndeposit 1 mole of product at the electrode.\n2 moles of electrons are required per mole of  \nPb formed\n= 2F\n= 2 × 96 500\n= 193 000 C mol–1\nStep 3  Calculate the charge transferred during  \nthe electrolysis.\nQ\t = I × t\n= 1.50 × 20 × 60\n= 1800 C\nStep 4  Calculate the mass by simple proportion using \nthe relative atomic mass.\n193 000 C deposits 1 mole Pb, which is 207 g Pb\nso 1800 C deposits ​  1800 \n_______ \n193 000 ​ × 207 = 1.93 g Pb\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nworked examples (continued)\n2\t Calculate the volume of oxygen produced at r.t.p. \nwhen a concentrated aqueous solution of sulfuric \nacid, H2SO4, is electrolysed for 30.0 min using a current \nof 0.50 A.  \n(F = 96 500 C mol–1; 1 mole of gas occupies 24.0 dm3  \nat r.t.p.)\nStep 1  Write the half-equation for the reaction.\n4OH–(aq)  \n  O2(g)  +  2H2O(l)  +  4e–\nStep 2  Find the number of coulombs required to \nproduce 1 mole of gas.\n4 moles of electrons are released\nper mole of O2 formed\n\t = 4F\n\t = 4 × 96 500\n= 386 000 C mol–1\nStep 3  Calculate the charge transferred during  \nthe electrolysis.\nQ \t= I × t\n= 0.50 × 30 × 60\n= 900 C\nStep 4  Calculate the volume by simple proportion \nusing the relationship 1 mole of gas occupies 24.0 dm3 \nat r.t.p.\n386 000 C produces 1 mole O2, which is 24 dm3 O2\nso 900 C produces ​  900 \n_______ \n386 000 ​  × 24.0\n= 0.0560 dm3 O2 at r.t.p.\nquestions\n5\t Calculate the mass of silver deposited at the cathode \nduring electrolysis when a current of 1.80 A flows \nthrough an aqueous solution of silver nitrate for \n45.0 min.\n(Ar value: [Ag] = 108; F = 96 500 C mol–1)\n6\t Calculate the volume of hydrogen produced at r.t.p. \nwhen a concentrated aqueous solution of sulfuric acid \nis electrolysed for 15.0 min using a current of 1.40 A.\n(F = 96 500 C mol–1; 1 mole of gas occupies 24.0 dm3  \nat r.t.p.)\n7\t Calculate the volume of oxygen produced at r.t.p. \nwhen a concentrated aqueous solution of sodium \nsulfate is electrolysed for 55.0 min using a current  \nof 0.70 A.\n(F = 96 500 C mol–1; 1 mole of gas occupies 24.0 dm3  \nat r.t.p.)\n\nChapter 20: Electrochemistry\nCalculating the Avogadro constant by an \nelectrolytic method\nThe Avogadro constant, L, is the number of specified \nparticles in 1 mole (see page 5).\nWe can use an electrolytic method to find a value for \nthe Avogadro constant by calculating the charge associated \nwith 1 mole of electrons.\nL = ​ charge on 1 mole of electrons \n \n \n________________________ \n \ncharge on 1 electron \n​\nWe can calculate the charge on the electron by experiment. \nThe results show us that the charge on the electron is \napproximately 1.60 × 10–19 C.\nFinding the charge on 1 mole of electrons\nThe charge on 1 mole of electrons can be found \nfrom a simple electrolytic experiment.

The mass of the anode \ndecreased by 0.45 g. Use this data to calculate the \ncharge on a mole of electrons.\n■\n■\nremove the cathode and anode and wash and dry \nthem with distilled water and then with propanone\n■\n■\nreweigh the cathode and anode.\nThe cathode increases in mass because copper is \ndeposited. The anode decreases in mass because \nthe copper goes into solution as copper ions. The \ndecrease in mass of the anode is measured. This is \npreferred because the copper does not always ‘stick’ \nto the cathode very well.\nA sample calculation is shown below, using a \ncurrent of 0.20 A for 34 min.\n■\n■\nmass of anode at start of the experiment = 56.53 g\n■\n■\nmass of anode at end of experiment = 56.40 g\n■\n■\nmass of copper removed from anode = 0.13 g\n■\n■\nquantity of charge passed Q\t = I × t\n\t\n= 0.20 × 34 × 60\n\t\n= 408 C\nTo deposit 0.13 g of copper requires 408 C,  \nso to deposit 1 mole of copper (63.5 g)\n278\nrequires ​ 63.5 \n____ \n0.13 ​ × 408 C\nBut the equation for the electrolysis shows that  \n2 moles of electrons are needed to produce 1 mole \nof copper:\nCu2+  +  2e–  \n  Cu\nThe charge on 1 mole of electrons\t = ​ 63.5 \n____ \n0.13 ​ × 408 × ​ 1 \n__ 2 ​\n= 99 600 C\nIf the charge on one electron is 1.60 × 10–19 C,\nL = ​ \n99 600 \n__________ \n1.60 × 10–19 ​ =  6.2 × 1023 mol–1 \n(to 2 significant figures)\nThis is in good agreement with the accurate value \nof 6.02 × 1023 mol–1.\n\nquestions\n(Ar value: [Ag] = 108)\n9\t An accurate value of the Faraday constant is \n96 485 C mol–1. An accurate value for the charge on \none electron is 1.6022 × 10–19 C. Use these values to \ncalculate a value of the Avogadro constant to \n5 significant figures.\nElectrode potentials\nIntroducing electrode potentials\nA redox equilibrium exists between two chemically related \nspecies that are in different oxidation states. For example, \nwhen a copper rod is placed in contact with an aqueous \nsolution of its ions the following equilibrium exists:\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Cu(s)\nThere are two opposing reactions in this equilibrium.\n■\n■\nMetal atoms from the rod entering the solution as metal \nions. This leaves electrons behind on the surface of the rod. \nFor example:\nCu(s)  \n  Cu2+(aq)  +  2e–\n■\n■\nIons in solution accepting electrons from the metal rod and \nbeing deposited as metal atoms on the surface of the rod. \nFor example:\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Cu(s)\nThe redox equilibrium is established when the rate of \nelectron gain equals the rate of electron loss.\nFor unreactive metals such as copper, if this \nequilibrium is compared with the equilibrium set up by \nother metals, the equilibrium set up by copper lies further \nover to the right.\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Cu(s)\nCu2+(aq) ions are therefore relatively easy to reduce. They \ngain electrons readily to form copper metal.",
