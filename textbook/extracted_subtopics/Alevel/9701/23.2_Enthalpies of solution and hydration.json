It requires a large amount \nof energy to overcome the attractive forces between the \nions. How does this happen, even when the water is not \nheated? We will answer this question in this section.\nEnthalpy change of solution\nThe enthalpy change of solution, ΔH O\n—\nsol, is the energy \nabsorbed or released when 1 mole of an ionic solid \ndissolves in sufficient water to form a very dilute solution.\nThe enthalpy changes of solution for magnesium chloride \nand sodium chloride are described by the equations below:\nMgCl2(s)  +  aq  \n  MgCl2(aq)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nsol = –55 kJ mol–1\nor\nMgCl2(s)  +  aq  \n  Mg2+(aq)  +  2Cl–(aq)\nΔH \nO\n—\nsol = –55 kJ mol–1\nNaCl(s)  +  aq  \n  NaCl(aq)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nsol = +3.9 kJ mol–1\nor\nNaCl(s) + aq \n Na+(aq) + Cl–(aq)\b ΔH \nO\n—\nsol = +3.9 kJ mol–1\nNote that:\n■\n■\nthe symbol for enthalpy change of solution is ΔH O\n—\nsol\n■\n■\nthe symbol ‘aq’ represents the very large amount of water \nused\n■\n■\nenthalpy changes of solution can be positive (endothermic) \nor negative (exothermic)\n■\n■\na compound is likely to be soluble in water only if ΔH O\n—\nsol is \nnegative or has a small positive value; substances with large \npositive values of ΔH O\n—\nsol are relatively insoluble.\na\nb\nHδ+\nδ–\nδ+\nH\nbond between\nions weakens\nbond forming\nO\nHδ+\n+\nO\nHδ+\nHδ+\nδ–\nO\nδ+ δ–\nH\nδ–\nHδ+\n–\n–\n+\n+\nδ+\nO\nO\nH\nδ–\n+\n+\n–\n–\nHδ+\nδ+\nH\n–\n–\n+\n+\nδ–\nH\nO\nO\nO\n+\n+\n–\n–\nH\nδ+\nδ+\nH\nlattice of ions\n\nChapter 19: Lattice energy\nQuestion\n12\t a\t \u0007Write equations to represent the enthalpy change of \nsolution of:\ni\t\npotassium sulfate\nii\t zinc chloride.\nb\t \u0007The enthalpies of solution of some metal halides are \ngiven below. What do these values tell you about the \nrelative solubilities of these four compounds?\nsodium chloride,\t ΔH O\n—\nsol = +3.9 kJ mol–1\nsilver chloride,\t\nΔH O\n—\nsol = +65.7 kJ mol–1\nsodium bromide,\tΔH O\n—\nsol = –0.6 kJ mol–1\nsilver bromide,\t\nΔH O\n—\nsol = +84.5 kJ mol–1\n‘Soluble’ and ‘insoluble’ are only relative terms. \nMagnesium carbonate is regarded as being insoluble \nbecause only 0.6 g of the salt dissolves in every dm3 of \nwater. No metallic salts are absolutely insoluble in water. \nEven lead carbonate, which is regarded as insoluble, \ndissolves to a very small extent: 0.000 17 g dissolves in \nevery dm3 of water. If salts were completely insoluble they \ncould not have a value for ΔH \nO\n—\nsol.\n265\nEnthalpy change of hydration\nThe lattice energy for sodium chloride is –788 kJ mol–1. \nThis means that we need to supply (at least) +788 kJ mol–1 \nto overcome the forces of attraction between the ions. But \nΔH \nO\n—\nsol [NaCl] is only +3.9 kJ mol–1. Where does the energy \nneeded to separate the ions come from? The answer is that \nit comes from the strong attraction between the ions and \nthe water molecules.\nWhen an ionic solid dissolves in water, bonds are \nformed between water molecules and the ions. These \nbonds are called ion–dipole bonds. Water is a polar \nmolecule. The δ– oxygen atoms in water molecules are \nattracted to the positive ions in the ionic compound. The \nδ+ hydrogen atoms in water molecules are attracted to the \nnegative ions in the ionic compound (Figure 19.9).\nnew bonds\nformed\nδ+\nHδ+\nδ–\nδ–\n–\nFigure 19.9  a  Water molecules \nforming

is \nsufficient to compensate for the energy that must be put \nin to separate the anions and cations that are bonded \ntogether in the crystal lattice.\nThe energy released when gaseous ions dissolve in \nwater is called the enthalpy change of hydration.\nThe enthalpy change of hydration, ΔH O\n—\nhyd, is the enthalpy \nchange when 1 mole of a specified gaseous ion dissolves \nin sufficient water to form a very dilute solution.\nThe enthalpy changes of hydration for calcium ions and \nchloride ions are described by the equations below:\nCa2+(g)  +  aq  \n  Ca2+(aq)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nhyd = –1650 kJ mol–1\nCl–(g)  +  aq  \n  Cl–(aq)\b\nΔH \nO\n—\nhyd = –364 kJ mol–1\nNote that:\n■\n■\nthe symbol for enthalpy change of hydration is ΔH O\n—\nhyd\n■\n■\nthe enthalpy change of hydration is
