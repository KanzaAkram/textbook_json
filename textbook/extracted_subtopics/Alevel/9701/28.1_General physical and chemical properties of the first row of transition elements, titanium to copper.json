Iron and copper \nhave been used for many centuries (Figure 24.1). \nIn more recent times, we have discovered how to\nFigure 24.1  The transition elements iron and copper are very important in the construction industry.\nWhat is a transition element?\nThe transition elements are found in the d block of the \nPeriodic Table, between Groups 2 and 13. However, not all \nd-block elements are classified as transition elements.\nA transition element is a d-block element that forms one \nor more stable ions with an incomplete d subshell.\nWe do not define Sc and Zn as transition elements.\n■\n■\nScandium forms only one ion (Sc3+) and this has no \nelectrons in its 3d subshell – the electronic configuration of \nSc3+ is (Ar) 3d0 4s0.\n■\n■\nZinc forms only one ion (Zn2+) and this has a complete \n3d subshell – the electronic configuration of Zn2+ is (Ar) \n3d10 4s0.\nIn this chapter we will be looking at the transition \nelements in the first row of the d block. These are the \nmetals titanium (Ti) through to copper (Cu), according to \nthe definition above.\nElectronic configurations\nAtoms\nTable 24.1 shows the electronic configurations of the atoms \nin the first row of the transition elements.\n\nChapter 24: Transition elements\nextract and use other, rarer transition elements. For \nexample, titanium is used in jet turbines because it can \nwithstand high temperatures and is very strong.\nIn atoms of the transition elements, the 4s subshell is \nnormally filled and the rest of the electrons occupy orbitals \nin the 3d subshell. However, chromium and copper \natoms are the exceptions. Chromium atoms have just one \nelectron in the 4s subshell. The remaining five electrons \nare arranged in the 3d subshell so that each orbital is \noccupied by one electron. Copper atoms also have just one \nelectron in the 4s subshell. The remaining ten electrons are \narranged in the 3d subshell so that each orbital is filled by \ntwo electrons.\n367\nElement\nElectronic configuration\ntitanium (Ti)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2 4s2\nvanadium (V)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d3 4s2\nchromium (Cr)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s1\nmanganese (Mn)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s2\niron (Fe)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d6 4s2\ncobalt (Co)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d7 4s2\nnickel (Ni)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d8 4s2\ncopper (Cu)\n1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s1\nTable 24.1  Electronic configurations of the first row of \ntransition elements.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nIons\nThe transition elements are all metals. In common with \nall metals, their atoms tend to lose electrons so they form \npositively charged ions. However, each transition metal can \nform more than one ion. For example, the common ions of \ncopper are Cu+ and Cu2+. We say that the transition metals \nhave variable oxidation states. The resulting ions are often \ndifferent colours (Figure 24.2).\na\nb\nc\nd\nFigure 24.2  Vanadium and its oxidation states: a  a solution \ncontaining VO2\n+ ions; b  a solution containing VO2+ ions; c  a \nsolution containing V3+ ions; d  a solution containing V2+ ions.\n368\nTable 24.2 shows the most common oxidation states of the \nfirst row of the transition elements.\nElement\nMost common oxidation states\ntitanium (Ti)\n+3, +4\nvanadium (V)\n+2, +3, +4, +5\nchromium (Cr)\n+3, +6\nmanganese (Mn)\n+2, +4, +6, +7\niron (Fe)\n+2, +3\ncobalt (Co)\n+2, +3\nnickel (Ni)\n+2\ncopper (Cu)\n+1, +2\nTable 24.2  Common oxidation states of the transition \nelements.\nThe existence of variable oxidation states means that the \nnames of compounds containing transition elements must \nhave their oxidation number included, e.g. manganese(IV) \noxide, cobalt(II) chloride.\nWhen transition elements form ions, their atoms  \nlose electrons from the 4s subshell first, followed by  \n3d electrons.\n\nNotice the partially filled d subshells (see definition of \ntransition element on the previous page) in the following \nexamples of ions:\nV atom = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d3 4s2\nV3+ ion = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d2 4s0\nFe atom = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d6 4s2\nFe3+ ion = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s0\nCu atom = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s1\nCu2+ ion = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d9 4s0\nThe most common oxidation state is +2, usually formed \nwhen the two 4s electrons are lost from the atoms. The \nmaximum oxidation number of the transition elements at \nthe start of the row involves all the 4s and 3d electrons in \nthe atoms. For example, vanadium’s maximum oxidation \nstate is +5, involving its two 4s electrons and its three \n3d electrons. At the end of the row, from iron onwards, \nthe +2 oxidation state dominates as 3d electrons become \nincreasingly harder to remove as the nuclear charge \nincreases across the period.\nQuestion\n1\t a\t \u0007State the electronic configurations of the following \natoms or ions:\ni\t\nTi\t\niv\t Fe3+\nii\t Cr\t\nv\t Ni2+\niii\t Co\t\nvi\t Cu+\nb\t \u0007Explain why scandium (which forms only one ion, \nSc3+) and zinc (which forms only one ion, Zn2+)  \nare not called transition elements.\nc\t\n\u0007Why is the maximum oxidation state of  \nmanganese +7?\nd\t \u0007Look back at the different oxidation states  \nof vanadium shown in Figure 24.2. State  \nthe oxidation state of the vanadium in each  \nphoto a–d.\ne\t \u0007Zirconium (Zr) is in the second row of transition \nelements beneath titanium in the Periodic Table. \nIts electronic configuration is [Kr]4d2 5s2, where [Kr] \nrepresents the electronic configuration of krypton, \nthe noble gas with atomic number 36.\ni\t\n\u0007Predict the maximum stable oxidation state of \nzirconium and explain your answer.\nii\t \u0007Give the formula of the oxide of zirconium, \nassuming zirconium exhibits the oxidation state \ngiven in e, part i.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nThe higher oxidation states of the transition elements \nare found in complex ions or in compounds formed \nwith oxygen or fluorine. Common examples are the \nchromate(VI) ion, CrO4\n2–, and the manganate(VII) ion, \nMnO4\n–.\nPhysical properties of the \ntransition elements\nThe transition elements commonly have physical \nproperties that are typical of most metals:\n■\n■\nthey have high melting points\n■\n■\nthey have high densities\n■\n■\nthey are hard and rigid, and so are useful as construction \nmaterials\n■\n■\nthey are good conductors of electricity and heat.\nThe first ionisation energy, the atomic radius and the ionic \nradius of transition elements do not vary much as we go \nacross the first row.

In general, the 1st ionisation energy \nwould increase as the increasing nuclear charge has a \ntighter hold on electrons filling the same main energy level \nor shell, and the shielding effect stays roughly the same. \nFor similar reasons the atomic radius and ionic radius of \na positively charged ion would be expected to decrease\n\nChapter 24: Transition elements\nacross a period. However, the transition elements show \nonly a very small variation.\nComparing the transition elements with \nan s-block element\nThe s-block metal that lies immediately before the first row \nof d-block elements in the Periodic Table is calcium (Ca), \nin Group 2. When we compare the properties of calcium \nwith the first row of transition elements we find some \ndifferences despite the fact that they are all metals. You \nneed to know the following comparisons:\n■\n■\nthe melting point of calcium (839 °C) is lower than that of a \ntransition element (e.g. titanium at 1660 °C)\n■\n■\nthe density of calcium (1.55g cm–3) is lower than that of a \ntransition element (e.g. nickel at 8.90 g cm–3)\n■\n■\nthe atomic radius of calcium (0.197 nm) is larger than that of \na transition element (e.g. iron at 0.116 nm)\n■\n■\nthe ionic radius of the calcium ion, Ca2+, (0.099 nm) is larger \nthan that of a transition element (e.g. Mn2+ at 0.080 nm)\n■\n■\nthe first ionisation energy of calcium (590 kJ mol–1) is \nlower than that of a transition element (e.g. chromium at \n653 kJ mol–1 or cobalt at 757 kJ mol–1)\n■\n■\nthe electrical conductivity of calcium is higher than that of a \ntransition element (with the exception of copper).\n369\nQuestion\n2\t a\t \u0007Explain why the 1st ionisation energy of calcium is \nlower than that of cobalt.\nb\t \u0007Explain why the density of calcium is lower than \nthe density of nickel.\nRedox reactions\nWe have seen how the transition elements can exist in \nvarious oxidation states. When a compound of a transition \nelement is treated with a suitable reagent, the oxidation \nstate of the transition element can change. Whenever a \nreaction involves reactants changing their oxidation states \nthe reaction is a redox reaction, involving the transfer \nof electrons. Remember that a species is reduced when \nits oxidation state is reduced (gets lower in value). Its \noxidation state is lowered when it gains electrons, and, as \nwell as being reduced, it is acting as an oxidising agent. For \nexample, in the half-equation:\nFe3+(aq)  +  e–   \n   Fe2+(aq)\n\tpale yellow\t\npale green\nFe3+ has been reduced to Fe2+ by gaining one electron. In the \nequation as shown Fe3+ is acting as an oxidising agent. For this\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nreaction to happen another half-equation is needed in which \nthe reactant loses one or more electrons, i.e. acts as a reducing \nagent. In Chapter 20 (page 286) we saw how we can use \nstandard electrode potential values, E \nO\n—\n   , to predict whether or \nnot such reactions should take place.\nAnother half-equation we could consider would be:\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–   \n   Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\n\t\npurple\t\npale pink\nBoth half-equations are written below as they appear in \ntables of data showing standard electrode potentials:\nFe3+(aq)  +  e–   \n   Fe2+(aq) \b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.77 V\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–   \n  Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.52 V\nCan Fe3+ ions oxidise Mn2+ to MnO4\n– ions, or can MnO4\n– \nions in acid solution oxidise Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions?\nThe magnitude of the positive values provides a \nmeasure of the tendency of the half-equations to  \nproceed to the right-hand side. The values show us that \nMnO4\n–(aq) is more likely to accept electrons and proceed \nin the forward direction, changing to Mn2+(aq), than \nFe3+(aq) is to accept electrons and change to Fe2+(aq). \nMnO4\n–(aq) is a more powerful oxidising agent than \nFe3+(aq). Therefore MnO4\n–(aq) ions are capable of \noxidising Fe2+(aq) ions to form Fe3+(aq), and the top  \nhalf-equation proceeds in the reverse direction.\nWe can now combine the two half-cells to get the \noverall reaction. Note that the sign of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) \nhalf-cell has changed by reversing its direction. the  \nFe2+/Fe3+ equation also has to be multiplied by 5 so that \nthe electrons on either side of the equation cancel out (this \ndoes not affect the value of E \nO\n—\n   ).\n370\n5Fe2+(aq)  \n  5Fe3+(aq)  +  5e–\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = –0.77 V\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–  \n  Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.52 V\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  5Fe2+(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  \n  \nMn2+(aq)  +  5Fe3+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.75 V\nThe relatively large positive value of E \nO\n—\n    (+0.75 V) tells \nus that the reaction is likely to proceed in the forward \ndirection as written. In fact we use this reaction to \ncalculate the amount of iron (Fe2+ ions) in a sample, such \nas an iron tablet, by carrying out a titration.\n\n■\n■\nA known volume (e.g. 25 cm3) of an unknown concentration \nof Fe2+(aq) is placed in a conical flask.\n■\n■\nA solution of a known concentration of potassium \nmanganate(VII) is put in a burette.\n■\n■\nThe potassium manganate(VII) solution is titrated against the \nsolution containing Fe2+(aq) in the conical flask.\n■\n■\nThe purple colour of the manganate(VII) ions is removed in \nthe reaction with Fe2+(aq). The end-point is reached when \nthe Fe2+(aq) ions have all reacted and the first permanent \npurple colour appears in the conical flask.\nFigure 24.3  Manganate(VII) ions can be used to determine \nthe percentage of Fe2+ in an iron tablet.\nYou can achieve a more accurate result for the mass of Fe2+ \nin a solution by using dichromate(VI) ions, Cr2O7\n2–(aq), \nto oxidise it in a titration. This is because compounds such \nas potassium dichromate(VI) can be prepared to a higher \ndegree of purity than potassium manganate(VII). In a \ntitration with Fe2+(aq) and dichromate(VI) we need an \nindicator of the end-point that will be oxidised as soon as \nthe Fe2+(aq) has all reacted.\nThe half-equation and value for E \nO\n—\n    for the use of \ndichromate as an oxidising agent is:\nCr2O7\n2–(aq) + 14H+(aq) + 6e–  \n  2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.33 V\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nworked example\n1\t 0.420 g of iron ore were dissolved in acid, so that all of \nthe iron present in the original ore was then present \nas Fe2+(aq).

When these ions \nare in solution the Fe2+ ion is surrounded by six water \nmolecules. Each water molecule bonds to the central \nFe2+ ion by forming a dative (co-ordinate) bond from the \noxygen atom into vacant orbitals on the Fe2+ ion (Figure \n24.4). The water molecules are called ligands and the \nresulting ion is called a complex ion. Its formula is  \nwritten as [Fe(H2O)6]2+. The shape of a complex with six \nligands is octahedral.\n\nChapter 24: Transition elements\nquestions\n3\t a\t \u0007Write two half-equations for the reactions \nthat take place when Fe2+(aq) is oxidised by \ndichromate(VI) ions.\nb\t \u0007Combine the two half-equations and write \nthe equation for the oxidation of Fe2+(aq) by \ndichromate(VI) ions.\nc\t\n\u0007Work out the E O\n—\nvalue of the cell made when the \ntwo half-cells in part a are connected and the \nreaction in part b takes place.
