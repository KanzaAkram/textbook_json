Figure 28.29 shows how to represent both forms. \nA polymer chain with mixture of cis- and trans- sections \ncan be made by varying the reaction conditions.\nNote the alternate double and single carbon–carbon \nbonds in poly(ethyne). It can conduct electricity because \nits π bonding spreads down the length of the polymer \nchain. The overlapping p orbitals on neighbouring carbon \natoms result in long bands of delocalised electrons that are \nfree to move along the length of the polymer chains (see \npages 80 and 383).\nLots of research has been carried out to produce other \nconducting polymers with extended π bonding systems. \nPoly(ethyne) and some other examples are shown by their \nskeletal formulae in Figure 28.29.\n426\nConducting polymers usually have other substances, \nsuch as iodine, added to improve their electrical \nconductivity. This is called ‘doping’. They have a number \nof advantages over the metal conductors that they can \npotentially replace. They do not corrode, are much less \ndense, and can be shaped more easily. For example, they \ncan be made into thin sheets to make flat panels that light\nn\ncis-poly(ethyne)\nn\ntrans-poly(ethyne)\nn\nN\nn\nn\nH\npoly(1,6-heptadiyne)\npoly(pyrrole)\npoly(phenylene)\nFigure 28.29  Some examples of conducting polymers – note \nthe alternate double and single carbon–carbon bonds.\n\nup.

Many addition \npolymers are made using one type of monomer, e.g. \npoly(propene) from propene monomers. However,  \nco-polymers can also be produced by using more than  \none type of unsaturated monomer, e.g. H2C    CH2 and  \nH2C    CHCOOH.\nii  Condensation polymers\nWhen identifying monomers used in condensation \npolymerisation, look out for the presence of two \nfunctional groups that will react with each other, \ngiving off a small molecule in the reaction. These two \nfunctional groups can be in the same molecule, as in \nthe case of poly(lactic acid) on page 421, or at either \nend of two different monomers, as in nylon 6,6 on \npage 413. The functional groups involved in condensation \npolymerisation are usually:\n■\n■\namines (\n NH2) and carboxylic acids (  COOH) producing a \npolyamide and H2O\n■\n■\namines (\n NH2) and acyl chlorides (  COCl) producing a \npolyamide and HCl\n■\n■\ncarboxylic acids (  COOH) and alcohols (\n OH) producing a \npolyester and H2O\n■\n■\nacyl chlorides (  COCl) and alcohols (\n OH) producing a \npolyester and HCl.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nDeducing the repeat unit of a polymer for \ngiven monomer(s)\ni  Addition polymers\nGiven a monomer with a C   C bond, simply turn the \ndouble bond into a C   C single bond and show the  \nbonds either side of the two C atoms that would continue \nthe chain:\naddition\npolymerisation\nmonomer\nrepeat unit\nii  Condensation polymers\nGiven monomers with two reactive functional groups, draw \nthe product formed when two monomers react together. \nThen take off the atoms at both ends that would be lost if \nanother two monomers were to react with those groups:\nH\nO\nO\nn\nC\nC\nO\nH\nO\n+\nH\nH\nH\nH\nC\nC\nC\nC\nO\nH\nO\nH\nn\nH\nH\nH\nH\nO\nO\nC\nC\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nO\nO\nn\n+\n(2n – 1) H2O\nDeducing the type of polymerisation \nreaction for a given section of a polymer \nchain\ni  Addition polymers\nPolymers resulting from addition polymerisation will have \nrepeat units with no functional groups in the actual chain\n\nChapter 28: Polymerisation\nof carbon atoms that forms the ‘backbone’ of the polymer. \nPoly(phenylethene) is an example:\npoly(phenylethene)\nNote that functional groups may be present on the side-\nchains, such as the nitrile group, \n CN. However, the \n‘backbone’ in addition polymers usually consists of a chain \nof carbon atoms.\nii  Condensation polymers\nPolymers resulting from condensation polymerisation will \nhave amide links (\n CONH  ) or ester links (\n COO\n) in \nthe ‘backbone’ of the polymer chain.

Having \ndecided whether the polymer was made in an addition \nor a condensation polymerisation, you can then split the \npolymer chain into its repeat units.\n427\ni  Addition polymers\nWith an addition polymer, you need to put the C   C \ndouble bond back into the monomer:\nH\nH\nH\nH\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\npart of addition polymer\nH\nH\nC\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nn\nrepeat unit\nmonomer\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nii  Condensation polymers\nWith condensation polymers, you need to identify \nthe atoms from the small molecules given off in the \npolymerisation reaction and replace them on the reactive \nfunctional groups in the monomers.\nO\nO\nO\nO\nN\nC\nN\nN\nC\nC\nN\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nO\nO\nN\nN\nC\nC\nH\nH\nrepeat unit\nH2N\nNH2\nand\nHOOC\nCOOH\nmonomers\nor\n428\nClOC\nCOCl\nSummary\n■\t Polymers are very large molecules that are built up \nfrom a very large number of small molecules known \nas monomers.\n■\t Remember from Chapter 15 that addition \npolymerisation occurs when an unsaturated \nmonomer, such as an alkene, bonds to itself in an \naddition reaction. Poly(ethene), poly(chloroethene) \nand poly(phenylethene) are all addition polymers.\n■\t Condensation polymerisation involves the loss  \nof a small molecule (usually water) in the reaction \nbetween two monomer molecules. Both  \npolyesters and polyamides are formed by \ncondensation polymerisation.\n■\t Polyamides are formed by condensation \npolymerisation between an amine group and a \ncarboxylic acid group. These groups may be in the \nsame monomer or on different monomers.

The numbers in the name of a particular \nnylon refer to the number of carbon atoms in the \nmonomers.\n■\t Condensation polymerisation between the amino \nand carboxylic acid groups in amino acids produces \na polypeptide or protein. The amide links in these \npolymers are known as peptide links (also known as \npeptide bonds).\n■\t The polyester called terylene® is formed by \ncondensation polymerisation of benzene-1,4-\ndicarboxylic acid with ethane-1,2-diol.
