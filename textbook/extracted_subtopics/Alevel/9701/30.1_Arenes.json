This occurs \nby substituting an atom, or group of atoms, for one or more \nhydrogen atoms attached to the benzene ring. The initial \nattack is usually by an electrophile, which is attracted to the \nhigh electron density around the benzene ring.\n384\nElectrophilic substitution with chlorine \nor bromine\nBenzene will react with bromine in the presence of an \nanhydrous iron(III) bromide catalyst. The catalyst can be \nmade in the reaction vessel by adding iron filings to the \nbenzene and bromine. The substitution reaction is:\nBr\nanhydrous\nFeBr3 catalyst\n+  HBr\n+  Br2\nAt first sight the electrophile that starts the attack on \nbenzene is not obvious. The electrophile is created when  \nan iron(III) bromide molecule polarises a bromine \nmolecule. The Br2 molecule forms a dative (co-ordinate) \nbond with iron(III) bromide by donating a lone pair of \nelectrons from one bromine atom into an empty 3d orbital \nin the iron. This draws electrons from the other bromine \natom in the Br2 molecule making it partially positive, \ncreating the electrophile.\n\nWe can think of the electrophile as a Br+ cation:\nBr\nBr\nFeBr3\nBr+\n  \n+ [FeBr4]–\nδ+\nδ–\nThe Br+ cation and the ‘electron-rich’ benzene ring are \nattracted to each other, as the mechanism below shows. \nRemember that the curly arrows show the movement of a \npair of electrons.\nBr\nH\nBr\nstage 1\n⎯⎯⎯→\n⎯⎯⎯→\nstage 2\n+ HBr\n[FeBr4]–\n(+FeBr3)\nBr+\n+\nA similar reaction happens when chlorine gas is bubbled \nthrough benzene at room temperature in the presence \nof a catalyst such as iron(III) chloride or aluminium \nchloride. The products of this electrophilic substitution \nare chlorobenzene and hydrogen chloride. The catalysts in \nthese reactions, i.e. FeBr3, AlCl3 and FeCl3, are known as \n‘halogen carriers’.\nWhen we halogenate methylbenzene or other \nalkylarenes, the halogen atom substitutes into the benzene \nring at positions 2 or 4. These positions are ‘activated’ \nby any electron-donating groups bonded directly to the \nbenzene ring (see Table 25.4 on page 390). Other  \nexamples of benzene compounds that are activated in \nthese positions are phenol and phenylamine. So when \nwe react methylbenzene with chlorine gas, using an \nanhydrous aluminium chloride catalyst, two products can \nbe made:\nCH3\nCH3\nCl\nCH3\nAlCl3\n + \n+  2HCl\n+  2Cl2\nCl\n2-chloromethyl-\n4-chloromethyl-\nbenzene\nbenzene\nIf excess chlorine gas is bubbled through, we can \nform 1-methyl-2,4-dichlorobenzene, 1-methyl-2,6-\ndichlorobenzene and 1-methyl-2,4,6-trichlorobenzene. \n(Remember that the 2 and 6 positions in substituted arenes \nare equivalent.)\nThe carbon–halogen bond in halogenoarenes is \nstronger than the equivalent bond in a halogenoalkane \nbecause one of the lone pairs on the halogen atom  \noverlaps slightly with the π bonding system in the benzene \nring. This gives the carbon–halogen bond a partial double \nbond character.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nNotice that the methyl side-chain is not affected under the \nconditions used in the reaction above. However, we learnt \non page 206 that chlorine will react with alkanes in the \npresence of ultraviolet (UV) light or strong sunlight. This \nis a free radical substitution reaction. So if the chlorine gas \nis passed into boiling methylbenzene, in the presence of \nUV light, the following reaction takes place:\nCH3\nCH2Cl\nboil\n +  HCl\n UV light\n+  Cl2\nchloromethyl-\nbenzene\nNote that there is no substitution into the benzene ring \nunder these conditions. In excess chlorine, eventually all \nthree of the hydrogen atoms on the methyl side-chain will \nbe replaced by chlorine atoms.\nQuestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write the equation for the reaction of chlorine  \nwith benzene in the presence of an iron(III) \nchloride catalyst.\n\u0007b\t \u0007What do we call this type of mechanism for the \nreaction in part a?\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Draw the mechanism of the reaction in part a, with \nCl+ as the attacking species and using curly arrows \nto show the movement of electron pairs.\n\u0007d\t \u0007Draw the displayed formula of the ‘tri-substituted’ \nhalogenoarene produced if methylbenzene is \nadded to excess bromine at room temperature in \nthe presence of iron(III) bromide.\n\u0007e\t \u0007How would the reaction in part d differ if the \nmethylbenzene and bromine were boiled in the \npresence of UV light?\n\u0007f\t\n\u0007Name the mechanism of the reaction in part e.\nNitration of benzene\nThe nitration of benzene is another example of an \nelectrophilic substitution. Nitration refers to the \nintroduction of the NO2 group into a molecule. In this \nreaction the electrophile is the NO2\n+ ion, known as the\n\nChapter 25: Benzene and its compounds\nnitronium ion (or nitryl cation). This is made from a \nmixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated \nsulfuric acid:\nHNO3  +  2H2SO4  \n  NO2\n+  +  2HSO4\n–  +  H3O+\nThis ‘nitrating mixture’ is refluxed with benzene at about \n55 °C to make nitrobenzene:\nNO2\n+  HNO3\n+  H2O\n⎯→\nThe mechanism of the electrophilic substitution is:\nNO2\nNO2\nH\n+\nstage 1\nstage 2\nNO2\n+\n+  H+\nIn stage 1 in the mechanism, the electrophile, NO2\n+, is \nattracted to the high electron density of the π bonding \nsystem in benzene. A pair of electrons from the benzene \nring is donated to the nitrogen atom in NO2\n+, and forms \na new covalent bond. At this point, benzene’s delocalised \nring of electrons is disrupted. There are now four π \nbonding electrons and a positive charge spread over five \ncarbon atoms.\nHowever, the full delocalised ring is restored in stage 2 \nwhen the C   H bond breaks heterolytically. Both electrons in \nthe C   H covalent bond go into nitrobenzene’s π bonding \nsystem, and hydrogen leaves as an H+ ion. There are now \nsix electrons spread over the six carbon atoms, so the \nchemical stability of the benzene ring is retained in this \nsubstitution reaction.\nFurther nitration of the nitrobenzene produces \n1,3-dinitrobenzene and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene. Unlike \nthe electron-donating methyl group in methylbenzene \n(which activates the 2 and 4 positions in the benzene \nring), the NO2 group is electron-withdrawing. This type \nof group (which includes COOH) deactivates the 2 and \n4 positions in the benzene ring. Therefore, when there \nis a nitro group bonded to the benzene ring, further \nsubstitution takes place at the 3 and 5 positions (see Table \n25.4, page 390).\n385\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n4\t \u0007a\t \u0007Copy and complete the two equations below, \nwhich can be used to show the nitration of \nmethylbenzene:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007C6H5CH3  +  NO2\n+  \n  \n  +  \n\t\n H2SO4\n\t\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007C6H5CH3  +  HNO3  \n  \n  +\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007Name the possible mono-substituted products \nin parts i and ii.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iv\t \u00071-methyl-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 1-methyl-\n2,4,6-trinitrobenzene are formed on further \nnitration of methylbenzene. Draw the \ndisplayed formula of each compound.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Benzene also undergoes electrophilic substitution \nwhen refluxed with fuming sulfuric acid for several \nhours. This is called sulfonation.

Examples include \nthe manufacture of detergents or the reactants needed to \nmake plastics, such as poly(phenylethene) – commonly \nknown as polystyrene. They can use a Friedel–Crafts \nreaction to substitute a hydrogen in the benzene ring for \nan alkyl group, such as a methyl (  CH3) or an ethyl  \n(  C2H5) group:\nCH3\nCH2CH3\nethylbenzene\nmethylbenzene\n\nThe same type of reaction can also be used to introduce an \nacyl group into a benzene ring. An acyl group contains an \nalkyl group and a carbonyl (C     O) group:\nCH2CH3\nO\nCH3\nO\nC\nC\nphenylpropanone\nphenylethanone\nFriedel–Crafts reactions result in the introduction of a \nside-chain into a benzene ring.\nThey are also called alkylation or acylation reactions.\nFor example:\nCH2CH3\nAlCl3\n +  HCl\ncatalyst\n+  CH3CH2Cl\nethylbenzene\nCH3\nO\nC\n+  CH3COCl\nAlCl3\n +  HCl\ncatalyst\nphenylethanone\nThe reactions involve attack on the benzene ring by an \nelectrophile carrying a positive charge on a carbon atom, \ni.e. a carbocation. \nThe electrophile is often formed by adding an \naluminium chloride catalyst to a halogenoalkane. This \ncreates the carbocation electrophile:\n1st step\nH\nCH3CH2  +  [AlCl4]–\n+\nC\nH3C\nCl\nAlCl3\nH\nThe carbocation electrophile then attacks the  \nbenzene ring:\n2nd step\nCH2CH3\nH\n[AlCl4]–\nCH2CH3\n+\n+\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nThe aluminium chloride catalyst is regenerated in the  \nfinal step:\n3rd step\nCH2CH3\nCH2CH3\nH\n+  [AlCl4]\n–\n+  HCl  +  AlCl3\n+\nFurther alkylation of the benzene ring can take place as \nthe reaction proceeds.\nOxidation of the side-chain in arenes\nThe presence of the benzene ring in an alkylarene, such as \nmethylbenzene, can affect the characteristic reactions of \nits alkyl side-chain. For example, alkanes are not usually \noxidised by a chemical oxidising agent such as potassium \nmanganate(VII). However in alkylarenes, the alkane side-\nchain is oxidised to form a carboxylic acid. For example, \nmethylbenzene produces benzoic acid when refluxed with \nalkaline potassium manganate(VII), and then acidified \nwith dilute sulfuric acid, or another strong oxidising \nagent such as acidified potassium dichromate(VI):\nCH3\nCOOH\n+\n+\n3[O]\nH2O\nquestions\n5\t \u0007a\t \u0007Copy and complete the two equations below, \nwhich can be used to show the alkylation and \nacylation of benzene, to produce the mono-\nsubstituted products.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007C6H6  +  CH3CH2CH2Cl  \n  \n  +\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007C6H6  +  CH3CH2CH2CH2COCl\n+\n\u0007b\t \u0007i\t\n\u0007Name the mono-substituted organic product \nin part a i.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007What class of compound is formed in part a ii?\n6\t \u0007Hexylbenzene is refluxed with alkaline potassium \nmanganate(VII) and then acidified with dilute sulfuric \nacid. The same experiment is carried out using hexane \nand the oxidising agent. Compare what would happen \nin these experiments.\n\nChapter 25: Benzene and its compounds\nPhenol\nPhenol, C6H5OH, is a crystalline solid that melts at \n43 °C. It is used to manufacture a wide range of products \n(Figure 25.5). Its structure is:\nOH\n387\nFigure 25.5  Araldite adhesive, compact discs and TCP® \nantiseptic (which contains 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, as  \ndoes Dettol®) are all manufactured using phenol as a  \nstarting material.\nThe melting point of phenol is relatively high for an aryl \ncompound of its molecular mass because of hydrogen \nbonding between its molecules. However, the large  \nnon-polar benzene ring makes phenol only slightly  \nsoluble in water, as it disrupts hydrogen bonding with \nwater molecules.\nPhenol is weakly acidic, losing an H+ ion from its \nhydroxyl group:\nC6H5OH(aq)  \n  C6H5O–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n\t\nphenoxide ion\nThe position of this equilibrium lies well over to the \nleft-hand side. However, phenol is still a stronger acid \nthan water or an alcohol. The values of pKa are shown in \nTable 25.3. Remember: the higher the value of pKa, the \nweaker the acid (see page 307).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nWeak acid\nDissociation in water\npKa at \n25 °C\nphenol\nC6H5OH(aq)  \n  C6H5O–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n10.0\nwater\nH2O(l)  \n  H+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\n14.0\nethanol\nC2H5OH(aq)  \n  C2H5O–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n16.0\nTable 25.3  Comparing the acidity of phenol, water  \nand ethanol.\nPhenol is more acidic than water, with ethanol being the \nleast acidic of the three compounds. We can explain this \nby looking at the conjugate bases formed on the right-hand \nside of the equations in Table 25.3. The phenoxide ion, \nC6H5O–(aq), has its negative charge spread over the whole \nion as one of the lone pairs on the oxygen atom overlaps \nwith the delocalised π bonding system in the benzene ring.\n–\nO\nO–\nCH3CH2\nethoxide ion, with\nphenoxide ion,\nwith negative\ncharge spread over\nthe whole ion\nnegative charge\nconcentrated on\n388\nthe oxygen\nThis delocalisation reduces the charge density of the \nnegative charge on the phenoxide ion compared with \nOH–(aq) or C2H5O–(aq). Therefore H+(aq) ions are not \nas strongly attracted to the phenoxide ion as they are to \nhydroxide or ethoxide ions, making phenoxide ions less \nlikely to re-form the undissociated molecules.\nAlternatively, we can explain the greater acidity of \nphenol by saying that phenol ionises to form a more  \nstable negative ion, so the ionisation of phenol is more \nlikely. This results in the position of equilibrium in the \nphenol equation in Table 25.3 lying further to the right-\nhand side (i.e. more molecules donating an H+ ion) than \nthe other equations.\nEthanol is a weaker acid than water because of the \nelectron-donating alkyl (ethyl) group attached to the \noxygen atom in the ethoxide ion. This has the effect of \nconcentrating more negative charge on this oxygen atom, \nwhich more readily accepts an H+ ion. This explains why \nthe position of equilibrium lies further to the left-hand \nside, favouring the undissociated ethanol molecules.\n\nQuestion\n7\t \u0007a\t \u0007Place the following molecules in order of their \nacidity, starting with the most acidic:\nCH3COOH   C6H5OH   HCl    C3H7OH   H2O\n\u0007b\t \u0007Would you expect methanol to be more or less \nacidic than phenol? Explain your answer.\nReactions of phenol\nWe can divide the reactions of phenol into those involving \nthe hydroxyl group, OH, and those involving substitution \ninto the benzene ring.\nBreaking of the OH bond in phenol\nAlthough phenol is only slightly soluble in water, it \ndissolves well in an alkaline solution. As you have just \nlearnt, phenol is a weak acid so it will react with an alkali \nto give a salt plus water:\n+  H2O\nOH + NaOH\nO–Na+\nThe salt formed, sodium phenoxide, is soluble in water.\nPhenol also reacts vigorously with sodium metal, giving \noff hydrogen gas and again forming sodium phenoxide:\nOH  +  2Na              2\nO–Na+  +  H2\n2\n⎯→\nSubstitution into the benzene ring  \nof phenol\nCompared with benzene, phenol reacts more readily \nwith electrophiles. The overlap of one of the lone pairs of \nelectrons on the oxygen atom in the OH group with the \nπ bonding system increases the electron density of the \nbenzene ring in phenol. This makes the benzene ring more \nopen to attack from electron-deficient electrophiles. It \n‘activates’ the benzene ring, especially at positions 2, 4  \nand 6 (see Table 25.4, page 390).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nBromination of phenol\nPhenol undergoes similar reactions to benzene, \nbut phenol does so under milder conditions. For \nexample, bromine water will not react with benzene \nat room temperature. To produce bromobenzene we \nneed pure bromine (not a solution) and an iron(III) \nbromide catalyst.\nHowever, bromine water reacts readily with phenol, \ndecolorising the orange solution and forming a white \nprecipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (see Figure 25.6):\nOH\nOH\nBr\nBr\n→\n+  3HBr\n+  3Br2\nBr\nSimilar reactions happen between phenol and chlorine  \nor iodine.\nThis activation of the benzene ring is also shown in \nthe nitration of phenol. With benzene, we need a mixture \nof concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids to reflux with \nbenzene at about 55 °C for nitration to take place (see \npage 385). However, the activated ring in phenol  \nreadily undergoes nitration with dilute nitric acid at \nroom temperature:\nOH\nOH\nOH\ndil.

This enables arenes to \nretain their delocalised π electrons. Hydrogen atoms \non the benzene ring may be replaced by a variety of \nother atoms or groups, including halogen atoms and \nnitro (\n NO2) groups, as well as alkyl or acyl groups \nin Friedel–Crafts reactions.\n■\t Despite the name ending in -ene, arenes do  \nnot behave like alkenes. Arenes undergo \nelectrophilic substitution, whereas alkenes undergo \nelectrophilic addition.\n■\t Sometimes the presence of the benzene ring \naffects the usual reactions of its side-chain, e.g. \nmethylbenzene is oxidised by refluxing with alkaline \npotassium manganate(VII) to form benzoic acid.\n390\nSubstituent groups in the benzene ring that direct \nthe in-coming electrophile to attack the 2, 4 and/\nor 6 positions.
