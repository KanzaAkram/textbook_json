    "content": "Proton (1H) nuclear magnetic \nresonance\nHow NMR works\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a \nwidely used analytical technique for organic compounds. \nNMR is based on the fact that the nucleus of each  \nhydrogen atom in an organic molecule behaves like a tiny \nmagnet. The nucleus of a hydrogen atom consists of a \nsingle proton. This proton can spin. The spinning motion \nof the positively charged proton causes a very small \nmagnetic field to be set up.\nIn NMR we put the sample to be analysed in a \nmagnetic field. The hydrogen nuclei (protons) either line \nup with the field or, by spinning in the opposite direction, \nline up against it (Figure 29.13).\nThere is a tiny difference in energy between the \noppositely spinning 1H nuclei. This difference corresponds \nto the energy carried by waves in the radiowave range \nof the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. In NMR \nspectroscopy the nuclei ‘flip’ between the two energy \nlevels (Figure 29.14). Only atoms whose mass number is an \nodd number, e.g. 1H or 13C, absorb energy in the range of \nfrequencies that are analysed.\nThe size of the gap between the nuclear energy levels \nvaries slightly, depending on the other atoms in the \nmolecule (the molecular environment). Therefore, NMR \ncan be used to identify 1H atoms in different parts of \na molecule. This is easier to visualise by looking at an \nexample. If we look at a molecule of methanol, CH3OH, we \ncan see that there are 1H atoms in two different molecular \nenvironments. We have the 1H atoms in the  CH3 group \nand the 1H atom in the  OH group. The energy absorbed \nby the  CH3 1H atoms is different from the energy \nabsorbed by the 1H atoms in  OH.\nIn NMR spectroscopy, we vary the magnetic field as \nthat is easier than varying the wavelength of radiowaves. \nAs the magnetic field is varied, the 1H nuclei in different\nH\nnucleus\nH\nnucleus\nFigure 29.13  Hydrogen \n(1H) nuclei will line up \nwith or against an applied \nmagnetic field.\nthis nucleus\nis lined up with\nthe applied ﬁeld\n\nChapter 29: Analytical chemistry\nthis small diﬀerence in energy\nlies in the radiowave range\n‘against’\nEnergy\nbefore ﬁeld\nis applied\nafter ﬁeld is applied\n‘with’\nFigure 29.14  Hydrogen (1H) nuclei will absorb energy in the \nradiowave range when they ‘flip’ from the lower energy level, \nlining up with the applied magnetic field, to the higher energy \nlevel, lining up against it.\nmolecular environments flip at different field strengths. \nThe different field strengths are measured relative to a \nreference compound, which is given a value of zero. The \nstandard compound chosen is tetramethylsilane (TMS). \nTMS is an inert, volatile liquid that mixes well with \nmost organic compounds. Its formula is Si(CH3)4, so all \nits H atoms are equivalent (i.e. they are all in the same \nmolecular environment). TMS only gives one, sharp \nabsorption, called a peak, and this peak is at a higher \nfrequency than most other protons (Figure 29.15). All \nother absorptions are measured by their shift away from \nthe TMS line on the NMR spectrum. This is called the \nchemical shift (δ), and is measured in units of parts per \nmillion (ppm).\n439\nsingle peak\nof TMS\n(which we use\nas a standard)\n0\nchemical\nshift (δ)\nFigure 29.15  The standard TMS peak used as a reference on \nNMR spectra.\ndirection of\nmagnetic ﬁeld\napplied in\nNMR spectrometer\nthis nucleus\nis lined up against\nthe applied ﬁeld\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nquestion\n4\t \u0007a\t \u0007Explain why tetramethylsilane (TMS) is used as a \nstandard in NMR spectroscopy.\n\u0007b\t \u0007In NMR we use solvents such as \ntetrachloromethane to prepare samples for the \nmachine (Figure 29.16).\n440\nFigure 29.16  Samples dissolved in a solvent in narrow \ntubes ready for NMR analysis.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007What is the molecular formula of \ntetrachloromethane?\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007Why do you think tetrachloromethane is used \nas a solvent?\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007Solvents that contain deuterium, D, are also \nused as solvents in NMR. Deuterium is the \nisotope 2H. A substance in which 1H is  \nreplaced by 2H is said to be deuterated. Why \nwould the deuterated solvent CDCl3 be used \ninstead of CHCl3?\n\nLow-resolution NMR\nA low-resolution NMR spectrum shows a single peak for \neach non-equivalent hydrogen atom; an example is shown \nin Figure 29.17.\nNote how the zero point on the x-axis, chemical shift \n(δ), is on the right of the spectrum and the shift increases \nin value going left.\nThere are three peaks on ethanol’s low-resolution \nNMR spectrum. These correspond to the 1H atoms in \n OH,  CH2\n and  CH3. Note how the heights of the \npeaks vary. The area under each peak tells us the relative \nnumber of equivalent 1H atoms responsible for that \nparticular chemical shift. The largest peak will be from \nthe  CH3 hydrogen atoms, the middle peak from the \n CH2\n  hydrogen atoms and the smallest peak from the \n OH hydrogen. The relative areas under the peaks are \nshown on the NMR spectrum by the labels 1H, 2H and 3H \n(Figure 29.17).\nThe type of H atom present can be checked against \ntables of data (Table 29.1) if you are using NMR to identify \nunknown organic compounds.\nUsing Table 29.1 we can see that the peak at about 1.2 ppm \nis caused by the   CH3 hydrogen atoms (range 0.7–1.6 ppm), \nthe peak at about 3.7 ppm corresponds to   CH2   hydrogen \natoms (range 3.3–4.3 ppm) and the peak at about 5.4 ppm is \ndue to the   OH hydrogen atom.\n3H\nAbsorption of energy\n2H\n1H\nδ/ ppm\n7.0\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\nFigure 29.17  The low-resolution NMR spectrum of \nethanol, CH3CH2OH.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nType of proton\nChemical shift, δ / ppm\nR   CH3\n0.7–1.6\nN   H\t\nR   OH\n1.0–5.5(a)\nR   CH2   R\n1.2–1.4\nR3CH\n1.6–2.0\nO\nRCH2\nC\nO\nH3C\nC\nCH2R\nCH3\nN   CH3\t\nN   CH2R\t\nN   CHR2\n2.3–2.9\nO   CH3\t\nO   CH2R\t\nO   CHR2\n3.3–4.3\nBr or Cl   CH3\t\nBr or Cl   CH2R\t\nBr or Cl   CHR2\n3.0–4.2\nCH   CH   \n45.–6.0\nO\nC\nNH2\nO\nO\nH\nC\n9.0–10\nO\nH\nC\n11.0–12.0(a)\nquestion\n5\t \u0007Predict the number of peaks and the relative areas \nunder each peak, where appropriate, on the low-\nresolution proton NMR spectrum of:\n\u0007a\t \u0007methanol, CH3OH\t\n\u0007d\t\n\u0007propan-1-ol\n\u0007b\t \u0007benzene, C6H6\t\n\u0007e\t\n\u0007propan-2-ol\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007chloroethane, C2H5Cl\t\n\u0007f\t\n\u0007propanone.\n\nChapter 29: Analytical chemistry\nO\nR2CH\nC\n2.0–2.9\nCHR2\n2.3–2.7\nOH\n4.5–10.0(a)\nNH\nC\n5.0–12.0(a)\n441\nH\n6.5–8.0\nTable 29.1  1H NMR chemical shifts relative to TMS. Chemical shifts are typical values that can vary slightly depending on the \nsolvent, concentration and substituents. (a)OH and NH chemical shifts are very variable (sometimes outside these limits and are \noften broad. Signals are not usually seen as split peaks).\nHigh-resolution NMR\nAs you can see in Table 29.1, the chemical shifts are given over \nranges, and the ranges for different types of hydrogen atoms \ndo overlap. In some molecules where there is heavy shielding \nof the hydrogen nuclei by lots of electrons in surrounding \natoms, peaks are shifted beyond their usual range. In such \ncases high-resolution NMR is useful. High-resolution NMR \ngives us more information to interpret. Peaks that appear \nas one ‘signal’ on a low-resolution NMR spectrum are often \nrevealed to be made up of a cluster of closely grouped peaks. \nThis is because the magnetic fields generated by spinning \nnuclei interfere slightly with those of neighbouring nuclei.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nThis interference is called spin–spin coupling. The exact \nsplitting pattern of a peak depends on the number of \nhydrogen atoms on the adjacent carbon atom or atoms.\nThe number of signals a peak splits into equals n + 1 \nwhere n is the number of 1H atoms on the adjacent  \ncarbon atom.\nThe high-resolution NMR spectrum of ethanol illustrates this \nn + 1 rule used to interpret splitting patterns (Figure 29.18).\n■\n■\nThe    CH3 peak is split into three because there are two 1H \natoms on the adjacent CH2 group. n + 1 = 3 (as n = 2); this is \ncalled a triplet.\n■\n■\nThe    CH2\n peak is split into four because there are three\n1H atoms on the adjacent    CH3 group. n + 1 = 4 (as n = 3); \nthis is called a quartet.\n■\n■\nThe    OH peak is not usually split as its 1H atom is \nconstantly being exchanged with the 1H atoms of other \nethanol molecules and any water present. This results in \none average peak being produced.\n1H\nAbsorption of energy\n442\n2H\nδ/ ppm\n6.0\n5.5\n5.0\n4.5\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\nFigure 29.18  The high-resolution NMR spectrum of ethanol, showing the splitting pattern in two of the peaks.

As we have seen on \npage 442, the peak is not split by the 1H atoms (protons) \non the neighbouring  CH2   group. The reason for this is \nthat the  OH proton exchanges very rapidly with protons \nin any traces of water (or acid) present, as follows:\nCH3CH2OH  +  H2O  \n  CH3CH2OH  +  HOH\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nThe hydrogen atoms involved in this reversible proton \nexchange have been coloured red and blue. The exchange takes \nplace so rapidly that the signal for the    OH protons becomes \na single peak. This exchange also happens in amines and \namides which contain the  NH   group.\nTable 29.3 shows the chemical shift ranges for the \ndifferent    OH and \n NH   signals.\nDifferent OH and NH protons\nRange of chemical \nshift (δ) / ppm\nin alcohols, R   OH protons\n1.0–5.5\nin phenols, arene   OH protons\n6.5–7.0\nin carboxylic acids, R   COOH protons\n11.0–11.7\nin amines,    NH2 /    NH    \n1.0–5.5\nin aryl amines, arene    NH2 \n3.0–6.0\nin amides,    CONH2  ,    CONH   \n5.0–12.0\nTable 29.3  Chemical shift ranges for \n OH and \n NH   \nprotons in different molecular environments.\nAs you can see from Table 29.1 (page 441), these ranges \noverlap with the chemical shifts of other types of \nproton. The signals can also appear outside the quoted \nranges under certain conditions, e.g. choice of solvent \nor concentration. This makes NMR spectra difficult to \ninterpret. However, there is a technique for positively \nidentifying    OH or \n NH   groups in a molecule. \nTheir peaks ‘disappear’ from the spectra if you add a \nsmall amount of deuterium oxide, D2O, to the sample. \nThe deuterium atoms (2H) in D2O, called ‘heavy water’, \nexchange reversibly with the protons in the    OH or\n444\nNH   groups. For example:\nOH  +  D2O  \n  \n OD  +  HOD\nNH   CO     +  D2O  \n  \n ND   CO     +  HOD\nThe deuterium atoms do not absorb in the same region \nof the electromagnetic spectrum as protons (1H atoms). \nThis makes the  OH or NH signal disappear from the NMR \nspectrum. By checking against the peaks in the original NMR \nspectrum, without D2O, we can tell if the    OH or    NH\ngroups are present in the sample. The 1H atom in the    OH or\nNH   group is referred to as a ‘labile’ proton.\n\nquestion\n7\t \u0007a\t \u0007Look back to Figure 29.18 on page 442. The high-\nresolution NMR spectrum shown is from a sample \nof ethanol containing traces of water. How would \nthe NMR spectrum differ if D2O had been added to \nthe sample of ethanol?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Look back to Question 6. How would repeating  \nthe NMR analysis using a solvent of D2O be able to \nhelp the pathologist distinguish between aspirin \nand paracetamol?\nCarbon-13 NMR spectroscopy\nIn addition to proton NMR. carbon-13 NMR is another \nanalytical tool used frequently by organic chemists. The \nvast majority of carbon atoms in any organic compound \nwill be the carbon-12 isotope. This isotope has an even \nmass number (12). Therefore it has no signal on an NMR \nspectrum, as NMR only works with atoms with an odd \nmass number (such as 1H, as we have already seen). \nHowever, about 1% of the carbon atoms in any sample of \nan organic compound will be the carbon-13 isotope. Its \nnuclei will interact with the magnetic field applied in NMR \nanalysis so can produce a NMR spectrum.\nCarbon-13 NMR produces a spectrum with different \nchemical shifts for non-equivalent carbon atoms in a \nmolecule. Typical carbon-13 NMR shifts are shown in \nTable 29.4. As in proton NMR, the chemical shifts are \nmeasured with reference to the TMS peak at 0 ppm on the \nspectrum (see page 439).\nAnalysis of carbon-13 NMR spectra is similar to that \nof proton NMR, looking to match different chemical shifts \nto characteristic molecular environments. However, the \nsignals produced in carbon-13 NMR appear as discrete \nvertical lines on the spectra (without the complication of \nthe splitting patterns caused by the protons in 1H atoms \nwithin the molecules). Take care in interpreting the \ncarbon-13 NMR spectra because the heights of the lines \nare not usually proportional to the number of equivalent \n13C atoms present.\nThe solvent used to prepare samples for 13C NMR \nanalysis is CDCl3. This accounts for the small signal near \n80 ppm that can be ignored when interpreting a spectrum, \nas it is caused by the atoms of 13C in the solvent molecules.",
