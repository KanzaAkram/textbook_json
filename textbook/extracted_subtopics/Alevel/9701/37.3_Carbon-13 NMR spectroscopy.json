The exchange takes \nplace so rapidly that the signal for the    OH protons becomes \na single peak. This exchange also happens in amines and \namides which contain the  NH   group.\nTable 29.3 shows the chemical shift ranges for the \ndifferent    OH and \n NH   signals.\nDifferent OH and NH protons\nRange of chemical \nshift (δ) / ppm\nin alcohols, R   OH protons\n1.0–5.5\nin phenols, arene   OH protons\n6.5–7.0\nin carboxylic acids, R   COOH protons\n11.0–11.7\nin amines,    NH2 /    NH    \n1.0–5.5\nin aryl amines, arene    NH2 \n3.0–6.0\nin amides,    CONH2  ,    CONH   \n5.0–12.0\nTable 29.3  Chemical shift ranges for \n OH and \n NH   \nprotons in different molecular environments.\nAs you can see from Table 29.1 (page 441), these ranges \noverlap with the chemical shifts of other types of \nproton. The signals can also appear outside the quoted \nranges under certain conditions, e.g. choice of solvent \nor concentration. This makes NMR spectra difficult to \ninterpret. However, there is a technique for positively \nidentifying    OH or \n NH   groups in a molecule. \nTheir peaks ‘disappear’ from the spectra if you add a \nsmall amount of deuterium oxide, D2O, to the sample. \nThe deuterium atoms (2H) in D2O, called ‘heavy water’, \nexchange reversibly with the protons in the    OH or\n444\nNH   groups. For example:\nOH  +  D2O  \n  \n OD  +  HOD\nNH   CO     +  D2O  \n  \n ND   CO     +  HOD\nThe deuterium atoms do not absorb in the same region \nof the electromagnetic spectrum as protons (1H atoms). \nThis makes the  OH or NH signal disappear from the NMR \nspectrum. By checking against the peaks in the original NMR \nspectrum, without D2O, we can tell if the    OH or    NH\ngroups are present in the sample. The 1H atom in the    OH or\nNH   group is referred to as a ‘labile’ proton.\n\nquestion\n7\t \u0007a\t \u0007Look back to Figure 29.18 on page 442. The high-\nresolution NMR spectrum shown is from a sample \nof ethanol containing traces of water. How would \nthe NMR spectrum differ if D2O had been added to \nthe sample of ethanol?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Look back to Question 6. How would repeating  \nthe NMR analysis using a solvent of D2O be able to \nhelp the pathologist distinguish between aspirin \nand paracetamol?\nCarbon-13 NMR spectroscopy\nIn addition to proton NMR. carbon-13 NMR is another \nanalytical tool used frequently by organic chemists. The \nvast majority of carbon atoms in any organic compound \nwill be the carbon-12 isotope. This isotope has an even \nmass number (12). Therefore it has no signal on an NMR \nspectrum, as NMR only works with atoms with an odd \nmass number (such as 1H, as we have already seen). \nHowever, about 1% of the carbon atoms in any sample of \nan organic compound will be the carbon-13 isotope. Its \nnuclei will interact with the magnetic field applied in NMR \nanalysis so can produce a NMR spectrum.\nCarbon-13 NMR produces a spectrum with different \nchemical shifts for non-equivalent carbon atoms in a \nmolecule. Typical carbon-13 NMR shifts are shown in \nTable 29.4. As in proton NMR, the chemical shifts are \nmeasured with reference to the TMS peak at 0 ppm on the \nspectrum (see page 439).\nAnalysis of carbon-13 NMR spectra is similar to that \nof proton NMR, looking to match different chemical shifts \nto characteristic molecular environments. However, the \nsignals produced in carbon-13 NMR appear as discrete \nvertical lines on the spectra (without the complication of \nthe splitting patterns caused by the protons in 1H atoms \nwithin the molecules). Take care in interpreting the \ncarbon-13 NMR spectra because the heights of the lines \nare not usually proportional to the number of equivalent \n13C atoms present.\nThe solvent used to prepare samples for 13C NMR \nanalysis is CDCl3. This accounts for the small signal near \n80 ppm that can be ignored when interpreting a spectrum, \nas it is caused by the atoms of 13C in the solvent molecules.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nsp3\nnext to chlorine (  CH2    Br and\nCH2   I are in the same range \nas alkyl)\nsp2\nalkene or arene\nTable 29.4  Typical 13C chemical shift values (δ) relative to TMS = 0. Note that chemical shifts are typical values and can vary \nslightly depending on the solvent, the concentration and substituents present.\nFigure 29.21 shows the 13C NMR spectrum for propanone, \n(CH3)2CO.\nNote that there are only two peaks: one for the carbon \natom in the carbonyl group, C   O, and the other for the \ncarbon atoms in the methyl groups,  CH3. Although \nthere are two  CH3 groups in propanone, they are both \nequivalent and so appear as only a single peak (just as \nequivalent H atoms do in proton NMR).\nH3C\nC\nO\nH3C\n200\n100\n0\n\nChapter 29: Analytical chemistry\nHybridisation of \ncarbon atom\nEnvironment of carbon atom\nExample structures\nChemical  / ppm \nshift range (δ)\nsp3\nalkyl\nCH3   , CH2  , \n CH   \n 0–50\nsp3\nnext to alkene/arene\n CH2   C   C,    CH2   \n10–40\nsp3\nnext to carbonyl/carboxyl\n CH2    COR,    CH2    CO2R\n25–50\nsp3\nnext to nitrogen\n CH2   NH2,    CH2    NR2,    CH2   NHCO\n30–65\nCH2   Cl\n30–60\nsp3\nnext to oxygen\n CH2    OH,   CH2   O   CO   \n50–70\n110–160\nC C\nC\nC   C ,\nC\nC\nC\nsp2\ncarboxyl\nR   CO2H, R   CO2R\n160–185\nsp2\ncarbonyl\nR   CHO, R   CO   R\n190–220\nsp2\nalkyne\nR   C   C   \n65–85\nsp2\nnitrile\nR   C   N\n100–125\n445\nFigure 29.22 shows another example of a carbon-13 NMR \nspectrum, that of ethylbenzene, C6H5CH2CH3.\nThe carbon atoms in the benzene ring are almost \nequivalent but will be affected to slightly different extents \nby the presence of the ethyl group in the molecule.
