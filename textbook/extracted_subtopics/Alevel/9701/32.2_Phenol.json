It is used to manufacture a wide range of products \n(Figure 25.5). Its structure is:\nOH\n387\nFigure 25.5  Araldite adhesive, compact discs and TCP® \nantiseptic (which contains 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, as  \ndoes Dettol®) are all manufactured using phenol as a  \nstarting material.\nThe melting point of phenol is relatively high for an aryl \ncompound of its molecular mass because of hydrogen \nbonding between its molecules. However, the large  \nnon-polar benzene ring makes phenol only slightly  \nsoluble in water, as it disrupts hydrogen bonding with \nwater molecules.\nPhenol is weakly acidic, losing an H+ ion from its \nhydroxyl group:\nC6H5OH(aq)  \n  C6H5O–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n\t\nphenoxide ion\nThe position of this equilibrium lies well over to the \nleft-hand side. However, phenol is still a stronger acid \nthan water or an alcohol. The values of pKa are shown in \nTable 25.3. Remember: the higher the value of pKa, the \nweaker the acid (see page 307).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nWeak acid\nDissociation in water\npKa at \n25 °C\nphenol\nC6H5OH(aq)  \n  C6H5O–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n10.0\nwater\nH2O(l)  \n  H+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\n14.0\nethanol\nC2H5OH(aq)  \n  C2H5O–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n16.0\nTable 25.3  Comparing the acidity of phenol, water  \nand ethanol.\nPhenol is more acidic than water, with ethanol being the \nleast acidic of the three compounds. We can explain this \nby looking at the conjugate bases formed on the right-hand \nside of the equations in Table 25.3. The phenoxide ion, \nC6H5O–(aq), has its negative charge spread over the whole \nion as one of the lone pairs on the oxygen atom overlaps \nwith the delocalised π bonding system in the benzene ring.\n–\nO\nO–\nCH3CH2\nethoxide ion, with\nphenoxide ion,\nwith negative\ncharge spread over\nthe whole ion\nnegative charge\nconcentrated on\n388\nthe oxygen\nThis delocalisation reduces the charge density of the \nnegative charge on the phenoxide ion compared with \nOH–(aq) or C2H5O–(aq). Therefore H+(aq) ions are not \nas strongly attracted to the phenoxide ion as they are to \nhydroxide or ethoxide ions, making phenoxide ions less \nlikely to re-form the undissociated molecules.\nAlternatively, we can explain the greater acidity of \nphenol by saying that phenol ionises to form a more  \nstable negative ion, so the ionisation of phenol is more \nlikely. This results in the position of equilibrium in the \nphenol equation in Table 25.3 lying further to the right-\nhand side (i.e. more molecules donating an H+ ion) than \nthe other equations.\nEthanol is a weaker acid than water because of the \nelectron-donating alkyl (ethyl) group attached to the \noxygen atom in the ethoxide ion. This has the effect of \nconcentrating more negative charge on this oxygen atom, \nwhich more readily accepts an H+ ion. This explains why \nthe position of equilibrium lies further to the left-hand \nside, favouring the undissociated ethanol molecules.\n\nQuestion\n7\t \u0007a\t \u0007Place the following molecules in order of their \nacidity, starting with the most acidic:\nCH3COOH   C6H5OH   HCl    C3H7OH   H2O\n\u0007b\t \u0007Would you expect methanol to be more or less \nacidic than phenol? Explain your answer.\nReactions of phenol\nWe can divide the reactions of phenol into those involving \nthe hydroxyl group, OH, and those involving substitution \ninto the benzene ring.\nBreaking of the OH bond in phenol\nAlthough phenol is only slightly soluble in water, it \ndissolves well in an alkaline solution. As you have just \nlearnt, phenol is a weak acid so it will react with an alkali \nto give a salt plus water:\n+  H2O\nOH + NaOH\nO–Na+\nThe salt formed, sodium phenoxide, is soluble in water.\nPhenol also reacts vigorously with sodium metal, giving \noff hydrogen gas and again forming sodium phenoxide:\nOH  +  2Na              2\nO–Na+  +  H2\n2\n⎯→\nSubstitution into the benzene ring  \nof phenol\nCompared with benzene, phenol reacts more readily \nwith electrophiles. The overlap of one of the lone pairs of \nelectrons on the oxygen atom in the OH group with the \nπ bonding system increases the electron density of the \nbenzene ring in phenol. This makes the benzene ring more \nopen to attack from electron-deficient electrophiles. It \n‘activates’ the benzene ring, especially at positions 2, 4  \nand 6 (see Table 25.4, page 390).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nBromination of phenol\nPhenol undergoes similar reactions to benzene, \nbut phenol does so under milder conditions. For \nexample, bromine water will not react with benzene \nat room temperature. To produce bromobenzene we \nneed pure bromine (not a solution) and an iron(III) \nbromide catalyst.\nHowever, bromine water reacts readily with phenol, \ndecolorising the orange solution and forming a white \nprecipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (see Figure 25.6):\nOH\nOH\nBr\nBr\n→\n+  3HBr\n+  3Br2\nBr\nSimilar reactions happen between phenol and chlorine  \nor iodine.\nThis activation of the benzene ring is also shown in \nthe nitration of phenol. With benzene, we need a mixture \nof concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids to reflux with \nbenzene at about 55 °C for nitration to take place (see \npage 385). However, the activated ring in phenol  \nreadily undergoes nitration with dilute nitric acid at \nroom temperature:\nOH\nOH\nOH\ndil.

This enables arenes to \nretain their delocalised π electrons. Hydrogen atoms \non the benzene ring may be replaced by a variety of \nother atoms or groups, including halogen atoms and \nnitro (\n NO2) groups, as well as alkyl or acyl groups \nin Friedel–Crafts reactions.\n■\t Despite the name ending in -ene, arenes do  \nnot behave like alkenes. Arenes undergo \nelectrophilic substitution, whereas alkenes undergo \nelectrophilic addition.\n■\t Sometimes the presence of the benzene ring \naffects the usual reactions of its side-chain, e.g. \nmethylbenzene is oxidised by refluxing with alkaline \npotassium manganate(VII) to form benzoic acid.\n390\nSubstituent groups in the benzene ring that direct \nthe in-coming electrophile to attack the 2, 4 and/\nor 6 positions.
