We can express \nthis mathematically as:\nrate of reaction = k × [cyclopropane]\nThe proportionality constant, k, is called the rate constant.\nThe overall expression (rate of reaction = k × [cyclopropane]) \nis the rate equation for this particular reaction. Rate \nequations are generally written without the × sign.  \nFor example:\nrate = k[cyclopropane]\nRate equations can only be determined from experimental \ndata. They cannot be found from the stoichiometric \nequation.\nSome experimentally determined rate equations are \nshown in Table 22.3.\nYou can see from equation 1 that the rate of reaction \nis proportional to the concentration of both H2 and I2; \nhowever, in equation 2, CO and O2 do not appear in \nthe rate equation, even though they are present in the \nstoichiometric equation. Similarly in reactions 3 and 4 \nthere is no relationship between the rate equation and the \nstoichiometry of the chemical equation.\n330\nStoichiometric equation\nRate equation\n1  H2(g)  +  I2(g)  \n  2HI(g)\nrate = k[H2] [I2]\nNO2(g)  +  CO2(g)\nrate = k[NO]2\n2  NO(g)  +  CO(g)  +  O2(g)\n2H2O(g)  +  N2(g) \nrate = k[H2] [NO]2\n3  2H2(g)  +  2NO(g)\n4  BrO3\n–(aq)  +  5Br–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n3Br2(aq)  +  3H2O(l)\nrate = k[BrO3\n–] [Br–] [H+]2\nTable 22.3  Rate equations for some reactions.\nIn order to find the rate equation we have to conduct a \nseries of experiments. Using reaction 3 as an example:\n■\n■\nfirst find how the concentration of H2(g) affects the rate \nby varying the concentration of H2(g), while keeping the \nconcentration of NO(g) constant\n■\n■\nthe results show that the rate is proportional to the \nconcentration of hydrogen (rate = k1[H2])\n\n■\n■\nthen find how the concentration of NO(g) affects the rate \nby varying the concentration of NO(g) while keeping the \nconcentration of H2(g) constant\n■\n■\nthe results show that the rate is proportional to the square \nof the concentration of NO (rate = k2[NO]2).\nCombining the two rate equations we get the overall rate \nequation: rate = k[H2] [NO]2.\nThe rate equations for some reactions may include \ncompounds that are not present in the chemical equation.\nQuestion\n4\t Write rate equations for each of the following reactions:\na\t cyclopropane \n propene\n\u0007where rate is proportional to the concentration of \ncyclopropane\nb\t 2HI(g)  \n  H2(g)  +  I2(g)\n\u0007where rate is proportional to the square of the \nhydrogen iodide concentration\nH+\n\t\nc\t\nC12H22O11(g)  +  H2O(l)  \n  2C6H12O6(aq)\n\u0007where rate is proportional to the concentration of \nC12H22O11 and to the concentration of H+ ions\nd\t 2HgCl2(aq)  +  K2C2O4(aq)\nHg2Cl2(s)  +  2KCl(aq)  +  2CO2(g)\n\u0007where rate is proportional to the concentration  \nof HgCl2 and to the square of the concentration  \nof K2C2O4\nH+\n\t\ne\t CH3COCH3  +  I2  \n  CH3COCH2I  +  HI\n\u0007where rate is proportional to the concentration of \nCH3COCH3 and to the concentration of H+ ions, but \nthe concentration of I2 has no effect on the rate.\nOrder of reaction\nThe order of a reaction shows how the concentration of a \nreagent affects the rate of reaction.\nThe order of reaction with respect to a particular reactant \nis the power to which the concentration of that reactant is \nraised in the rate equation.\nFor example, for a rate equation involving only one \nparticular reactant, the order is the power of the \nconcentration shown in the rate equation. For equation 2\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nin Table 22.3, the rate equation is rate = k[NO]2 and so the \norder is 2 with respect to [NO].\nWhen you are writing about order of reaction, you \nmust distinguish carefully between the order with respect \nto a particular reactant and the overall order of reaction. \nTaking equation 3 in Table 22.3 as an example:\nrate = k[H2] [NO]2\nWe say that this reaction is:\n■\n■\nfirst-order with respect to H2  \n(as rate is proportional to [H2]1)\n■\n■\nsecond-order with respect to NO  \n(as rate is proportional to [NO]2)\n■\n■\nthird-order overall (as the sum of the powers is 1 + 2  = 3).\nIn general terms, for a reaction A  +  B  \n  products, the \nrate equation can be written in the form:\nrate of reaction = k[A]m[B]n\nIn this equation:\n■\n■\n[A] and [B] are the concentrations of the reactants\n■\n■\nm and n are the orders of the reaction\n■\n■\nthe values of m and n can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or rarely higher\n■\n■\nwhen the value of m or n is 0 we can ignore the \nconcentration term because any number to the power of \nzero = 1.\nOrders of reaction are not always whole numbers. A few \nreactions have fractional orders. For example, the reaction:\nCH3CHO(g)  \n  CH4(g)  +  CO(g)\nhas an overall order of 1.5. The rate equation for this \nreaction is:\nrate = k[CH3CHO]1.5\nMany reactions involving free radicals have fractional \norders of reaction.\nQuestion\n5\t For each of the reactions a to e in question 4, state:\ni\t\n\u0007the order of reaction with respect to each reactant\nii\t the overall order of reaction.\n\nChapter 22: Reaction kinetics\nUnits of k\nThe units of k vary according to the form of the rate \nequation.\nworked examples\n1\t From equation 1 in Table 22.3.\nStep 1  Write the rate equation\nrate = k[H2] [I2]\nStep 2  Rearrange the equation in terms of k.\nk = ​  rate \n_______ \n[H2] [I2] ​\nStep 3  Substitute the units.\nk = ​ \nmol dm–3 s–1 \n \n____________________ \n \n(mol dm–3) × (mol dm–3) ​\nStep 4  Cancel mol dm–3 .\nk = ​ \nmol dm–3 s–1 \n \n____________________ \n \n(mol dm–3) × (mol dm–3) ​\nStep 5  Units of k.\nunits of k =s–1 mol–1 dm3 = dm3 mol–1 s–1\n■\n■\nwhen writing the units on one line, the indices on \nthe bottom change sign\n331\n■\n■\nwe usually put the unit with the positive index first\n■\n■\ndon’t forget the s–1 arising from the units of rate.\n2\t From equation 3 in Table 22.3.\nStep 1  Write the rate equation.\nrate = k[H2] [NO]2\nStep 2  Rearrange the equation in terms of k.\nk = ​ \nrate \n_________ \n[H2] [NO]2 ​\nStep 3  Substitute the units.\nk = ​ \nmol dm–3 s–1 \n \n_____________________ \n \n(mol dm–3) × (mol dm–3)2 ​\nStep 4  Cancel mol dm–3.\nk = ​ \nmol dm–3 s–1 \n \n_____________________ \n \n(mol dm–3) × (mol dm–3)2 ​\nStep 5  Units of k.\nunits of k =s–1 mol–2 dm6 = dm6 mol–2 s–1\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nQuestion\n6\t State the units of k corresponding to each of the \nfollowing rate equations:\na\t rate = k[NO]2\nb\t rate = k[NH3]0\nc\t\nrate = k[BrO3\n–] [Br –][H+]2\nd\t rate = k[cyclopropane]\nWhich order of reaction?\nWe can identify the order of a reaction in three ways:\n■\n■\nplot a graph of reaction rate against concentration  \nof reactant\n■\n■\nplot a graph of concentration of reactant against time\n■\n■\ndeduce successive half-lives from graphs of concentration \nagainst time.\nGraphs of reaction rate against \nconcentration\nA graph of reaction rate against concentration tells us \nwhether a reaction is zero, first, second or third order with \nrespect to a particular reagent (or overall). It is very rare to \nobtain an order with respect to a particular reagent higher \nthan second order. Figure 22.9 shows the shapes of the \ngraphs expected for different orders of reaction.\n332\nFigure 22.9  Zero-, first- and second-order reactions: how \nchanges in the concentration of a reactant affect the  \nreaction rate.\nWe shall now look at some examples of zero-, first- and \nsecond-order reactions.\n\nZero-order\nhot tungsten\n2NH3(g)  \n  N2(g)  +  3H2(g)\nThe rate equation derived from experiments is:\nrate = k[NH3]0\nThe plot of reaction rate against concentration is a \nhorizontal straight line (see Figure 22.9). The reaction \nrate does not change with concentration. For a zero-order \nreaction, k is numerically equal to the reaction rate:\nrate = k\nThis is because any number to the power of zero = 1.\nFirst-order\ngold\n2N2O(g)  \n  2N2(g)  +  O2(g)\nThe rate equation derived from experiments is:\nrate = k[N2O]1\nThis is usually written as:\nrate = k[N2O]\nThe plot of reaction rate against concentration is an \ninclined straight line going through the origin (see Figure \n22.9). The rate is directly proportional to the concentration \nof N2O. So doubling the concentration of N2O doubles the \nrate of reaction.\nSecond-order\nNO2(g)  +  CO(g)  \n  NO(g)  +  CO2(g)\nThe rate equation derived from experiments is:\nrate = k[NO2]2\nThe plot of reaction rate against concentration is an \nupwardly curved line (see Figure 22.9).\nIn this case, reaction rate is directly proportional to \nthe square of the concentration of NO2(g). When the \nconcentration of NO2(g) doubles, the rate of reaction \nincreases four-fold. If we consider the second-order rate \nequation as written above, we can see that this is true \nby comparing the rates at two different concentrations, \n1 mol dm–3 and 2 mol dm–3.\nrate at 1 mol dm–3 = k(1)2 = 1k\nrate at 2 mol dm–3 = k(2)2 = 4k\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nQuestion\n7\t Draw sketch graphs of reaction rate against \nconcentration of the reactant in bold for each of the \nfollowing reactions:\na\t NO(g)  +  CO(g)  +  O2(g)  \n  NO2(g)  +  CO2(g)\nfor which the rate equation is:\nrate = k[NO]2\ngold\n\t\nb\t 2HI(g)  \n  H2(g)  +  I2(g)\nfor which the rate equation is:\nrate = k\n\u0007Note: the catalyst influences the order here – \nthe order is not the same as for the uncatalysed \nreaction.\nc\t\n(CH3)3CCl  +  OH–  \n  (CH3)3COH  +  Cl–\nfor which the rate equation is:\nk[(CH3)3CCl]\nGraphs of concentration of reactant \nagainst time\nFigure 22.10 shows how we can distinguish between zero-, \nfirst- and second-order reactions by plotting a graph of \nconcentration against time.\nFor a zero-order reaction, the graph is a descending \nstraight line. The rate of reaction is the slope (gradient) of \nthe graph.

The curve for the second-order reaction is much \ndeeper than for a first-order reaction. It also appears to \nhave a relatively longer ‘tail’ as it levels off. We can also \ndistinguish between these two curves by determining \nsuccessive half-lives of the reaction.\nQuestion\n8\t For each of the reactions a to c in question 7, draw a \nsketch graph to show how the concentration of the \nbold reactant changes with time.\nHalf-life and reaction rates\nHalf-life, t​ 1 _ \n2 ​, is the time taken for the concentration of a \nreactant to fall to half of its original value.\nFigure 22.11 shows how half-life is measured for the \ncyclopropane to propene reaction that we studied earlier. \nThree successive half-lives are shown.

The mean half-life \nis 17.0 minutes for this reaction. We can tell that this reaction \nis first order because the successive half-lives are more or \nless constant. In a first-order reaction like this the half-life \nis independent of the original concentration of reactant. \nThis means that whatever the starting concentration of \ncyclopropane, the half-life will always be 17 minutes.\nWe can distinguish zero-, first- and second-order \nreactions from their successive half-lives (Figure 22.12).\nzero order\nﬁrst order\nsecond order\nConcentration\nConcentration\nConcentration\n1\n2t   (2)\nt   (1)\n1\n2\n1\n2\nt   (2)\nt   (1)\n1\n2\n1\n2t   (2)\nt   (1)\n1\n2\nTime\nTime\nTime\nFigure 22.12  The half-life of zero-, first- and second-order \nreactions can be determined from graphs of concentration \nagainst time.\n■\n■\nA zero-order reaction has successive half-lives which decrease \nwith time.\n334\n■\n■\nA first-order reaction has a half-life which is constant.\n■\n■\nSecond-order reactions have successive half-lives which increase \nwith time.

The only \nthing we can be sure of is that the reaction is second \norder overall.\nQuestion\n11\t Suggest how the experiment for the reaction  \nbetween methanol and hydrochloric acid might be \nre-designed to obtain evidence for the effect of \nchanging the HCl concentration whilst controlling the \nCH3OH concentration.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nUsing initial rates\nThe initial rates method is often used when the rate of \nreaction is slow.\n■\n■\nCarry out several experiments with different known initial \nconcentrations of each reactant.\n■\n■\nMeasure the initial rates of reaction by either:\n–\t taking the tangent of the curve at the start of each \nexperiment or\n–\t measuring the concentration of a reactant or product \nsoon after the experiment has started.\n■\n■\nFor each reactant, plot a graph of initial rate against \nconcentration of that particular reactant.\n12\t a\t \u0007State the order of reaction for the decomposition \nof nitrogen(V) oxide.\nworked example\n4\t Nitrogen(V) oxide, N2O5, decomposes to nitrogen(IV) \noxide and oxygen.\n2N2O5(g)  \n  4NO2(g)  +  O2(g)\nTable 22.8 shows how the initial rate of reaction varies \nwith the initial concentration of N2O5.\nInitial concentration, \n[N2O5] / mol dm–3\nInitial rate /  \n10–5 mol dm–3 s–1\n3.00\n3.15\n1.50\n1.55\n0.75\n0.80\nTable 22.8  Data for the decomposition of nitrogen(V) \noxide.\n3.00\nInitial rate / 10–5mol dm–3s–1\n2.00\nrate ∝[N2O5]\nrate = k [N2O5]\n1.00\nk = rate\n[N2O5]\n0\n0\n1.00\n2.00\n3.00\nInitial concentration, [N2O5]/ moldm–3\nFigure 22.15  The initial rate of decomposition of \nnitrogen(V) oxide is directly proportional to the  \ninitial concentration.\n\nChapter 22: Reaction kinetics\nworked example (continued)\nA graph of the data (Figure 22.15) shows that the initial \nrate of reaction is directly proportional to the initial \nconcentration of N2O5.\nrate of reaction\t∝ [N2O5]\n= k[N2O5]\nQuestion\nb\t \u0007Use the data for 3.00 mol dm–3 N2O5 in Table 22.8\nto calculate a value for the rate constant for this \ndecomposition.\nworked example\n5\t The equation below describes the reaction of \npropanone with iodine.

We call this the reaction \nmechanism. These steps do not take place at the same \nrate. The overall rate of reaction depends on the slowest \nstep. We call this the rate-determining step. If the \nconcentration of a reactant appears in the rate equation, \nthen that reactant (or substances that react together \nto form it) appears in the rate-determining step. If a \nsubstance does not appear in the overall rate equation it \ndoes not take part in the rate-determining step. So, for \nthe reaction between propanone and iodine, H+ ions are \ninvolved in the rate-determining step but iodine is not.\nVerifying possible reaction mechanisms\nWe can use kinetic data to confirm proposed reaction \nmechanisms. It is important to realise that the mechanism is not \ndeduced from the kinetic data. The kinetic data simply show us \nthat a proposed reaction mechanism is possible.\nVarious mechanisms have been proposed for the \nreaction\nH+\nCH3COCH3  +  I2  \n  CH3COCH2I  +  HI\nFigure 22.17 shows one proposed mechanism.\nThe rate equation for this reaction is\nrate = k[CH3COCH3] [H+]\nWe could not have deduced this reaction mechanism from \nthe rate equation. But the mechanism is consistent with \nthe rate equation.\nThe slow step (the rate-determining step) does not \ninvolve either propanone or hydrogen ions directly. \nHowever, the intermediate with the formula\n+OH\n\t\nCH3   C    CH3\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nfast\nO\n+OH\nCH3   +  H+\nCH3\nC\nCH3\nC\nCH3\n+OH\nOH\nslow\nC\n⎯⎯→\nC\n+ H +\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nCH2\n+ I2\nC\nfast\nOH\n+OH\nC\nCH2I + I–\n⎯⎯→\nCH3\nCH3\nCH2\n+OH\nCH3\nfast\nO\nCH2I  +  I–\nC\nCH2I   +   HI\nC\nCH3\nFigure 22.17  Propanone molecules rapidly accept hydrogen \nions to form an intermediate that slowly forms propen-2-ol. \nThis reacts rapidly with iodine to give the products.\nis derived from substances that react together to form it \n(propanone and hydrogen ions). So both [CH3COCH3] \nand [H+] appear in the rate equation.\nThe reaction between iodine and the intermediate\nslow\n1\nslow\n1\nin the ﬁrst step – each molecule breaks down,\nthey don’t collide in pairs\nslow\nN2O5\nNO2 + NO3\n1\n(note that two molecules of N2O5 need to have \nreacted for subsequent steps to be completed)\nReaction steps:\nfast\nNO2 + NO3\nNO + NO2 + O2\n2\nfast\nNO + NO3\n2NO2\n3\nFigure 22.18  The rate equation tells us that the decomposition of individual molecules of nitrogen(V) oxide is the  \nrate-determining step. The subsequent reactions are very much faster by comparison, and do not influence the overall rate.  \nTry to match the reaction steps with the illustrations to get a picture of what is happening.\n\nChapter 22: Reaction kinetics\nCH3C(OH)   CH2 is fast and iodine molecules are \nnot involved in the mechanism until after the rate-\ndetermining step. So the rate of reaction does not depend \non the concentration of iodine.\nOn page 337 we saw that the rate equation for the reaction\n2N2O5(g)  \n  4NO2(g)  +  O2\nis rate = k[N2O5]. Figure 22.18 shows a suggested \nmechanism for this reaction. The rate equation \nsuggests that a single N2O5 molecule is involved in the \nrate-determining step. This fits in with the proposed \nmechanism that suggests that the decomposition of N2O5 \nto form NO2 and NO3 is the slow step. The steps that follow \nthe slow step are relatively fast and so have no effect on \nreaction rate.\nIf there is only a single species (atom, ion or molecule) \nin the rate-determining step we call the reaction \nunimolecular. If two species (which can be the same or \ndifferent) are involved in the rate-determining step, we say \nthat the reaction is bimolecular. Mechanisms that involve \na trimolecular step are rare. This is because it is unlikely \nthat three species will collide at the same time.\n339\nfast\n2\nfast\n+\n3",
