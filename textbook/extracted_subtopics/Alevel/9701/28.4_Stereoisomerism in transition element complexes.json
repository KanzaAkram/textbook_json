A single EDTA4– \nion can form six co-ordinate bonds to a central \ntransition metal ion to form an octahedral \ncomplex. It is called a hexadentate ligand. Give the \nformula of such a complex formed between Ni2+ \nand EDTA4–.\nc\t\nWhich ligands in Table 24.4 are bidentate?\nStereoisomerism in transition metal \ncomplexes\nIn Chapter 14 (pages 195–6) we learnt about two \ntypes of stereoisomerism: geometric isomerism and \noptical isomerism. The presence of a double bond in \n1,2-dibromoethane means that two geometrical isomers \n(cis-trans isomers) are possible. Geometric isomerism \nis also possible in transition metal complexes, where\nCH2\nNH2\nH2C\nH2N\nNH2\nNi\nCH2\nH2N\nNH2\nNH2\nH2C\nCH2\nen\nb\nen\nen\nNi\n\nChapter 24: Transition elements\nno double bond exists. In this case, the term geometric \nisomerism refers to complexes with the same molecular \nformula but different geometrical arrangements of their \natoms. Examples are cis- and trans-platin (Figure 24.8).  \nIn cis-platin, the chlorine atoms are next to each other  \nin the square complex but in trans-platin, they are \nopposite. The properties of these geometrical isomers  \nare slightly different.\nNH3\nCI\nCl\nNH3\nPt\nPt\nNH3\nCI\nH3N\nCl\ncis-platin\ntrans-platin\nFigure 24.8  The geometrical isomers, cis-platin and  \ntrans-platin.\nCis-platin has been used as an anti-cancer drug. It acts by \nbinding to sections of the DNA in cancer cells, preventing \ncell division.\nStereoisomerism is commonly shown by octahedral \n(six co-ordinate) complexes associated with bidentate \nligands. An example is the complex containing \nnickel as the transition metal and 1,2-diaminoethane \n(NH2CH2CH2NH2) as the bidentate ligand (Figure \n24.9). The two isomers are stereoisomers because the two \ndifferent molecules are mirror images of each other and \ncannot be superimposed.\n373\n2+\n2+\na\nCH2\nCH2\nH2N\nNH2\nH2N\nCH2\nNi\nH2C\nH2C\nNH2\nH2N\nH2N\nCH2\nCH2\n2+\n2+\nen\nNi\nen\nen\nFigure 24.9  The two non-superimposable optical isomers of Ni(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3\n2+: a  the full structure; b  a simplified structure \nwith ‘en’ representing a molecule of 1,2-diaminoethane.",
