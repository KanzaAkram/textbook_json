The term –ΔH \nO\n—\nreaction/T has a negative \nvalue. If the value of ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem and ΔS \nO\n—\nsurroundings are both \nnegative, then the reaction will not be spontaneous. \nHowever, if the value of ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem is positive and large \nenough, it can compensate for the negative value of the  \nΔS \nO\n—\nsurroundings so that ΔS \nO\n—\ntotal becomes positive. The reaction \nis spontaneous.\nChemists are usually interested in the system of \nreactants and products rather than having to consider the \nenergy changes with the surroundings. Fortunately for \nus, there is a way in which we can take account of both \nsystem and surroundings in a more straightforward way. \nThis involves a quantity called Gibbs free energy or, more \nsimply, free energy. It can also be called Gibbs energy or \nGibbs function, G.\n358\nFigure 23.7  Gibbs free energy is named after American \nscientist Josiah Willard Gibbs, who applied the concept of \nentropy and ‘applied energy’ changes to chemical reactions \nand physical processes.\nGibbs free energy\nWhat is Gibbs free energy?\nIn determining whether a chemical reaction is likely to  \nbe spontaneous we use the quantity Gibbs free energy \nchange, ΔG. The Gibbs free energy change is given by  \nthe relationship:\nΔG = –TΔStotal\n\nWe can also write the expression without having to \nconsider the entropy changes of the surroundings:\nΔG = ΔHreaction – TΔSsystem\nWhere T is the temperature in kelvin.\nGibbs free energy is a useful concept because it includes \nboth enthalpy change and entropy change.\nTo make any comparison of Gibbs free energy values \nfair, we must use standard conditions. These standard \nconditions are the same as those used for ΔH and ΔS:\n■\n■\npressure of 105 Pa\n■\n■\ntemperature of 298 K (25 °C)\n■\n■\neach substance involved in the reaction is in its normal \nphysical state (solid, liquid or gas) at 105 Pa and 298 K.\nThe standard molar Gibbs free energy of formation is  \nthe free energy change that accompanies the formation \nof one mole of a compound from its elements in their \nstandard state.\nThe symbol for standard molar Gibbs free energy of \nformation is ΔG \nO\n—\nf . The units are kJ mol–1.\nFor example:\nMg(s)  +  ​ 1 _ \n2 ​ O2(g)  \n  MgO(s)\b\nΔG \nO\n—\nf  = –569.4 kJ mol–1\nDerivation\nGibbs free energy can easily be derived from the equation \nrelating total entropy to the entropy changes of system and \nsurroundings.\nAs:\nΔS \nO\n—\ntotal = ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem – ​ ΔH \nO\n—\n    \n_____ \nT  ​\nMultiplying by –T: –TΔS \nO\n—\ntotal  = –TΔS \nO\n—\nsystem  +  ΔH \nO\n—\n   \nThe term –TΔS \nO\n—\nsystem  +  ΔH \nO\n—\n    is equivalent to the Gibbs \nfree energy change of the reaction system ΔG \nO\n—\n   .\nSo –TΔS \nO\n—\ntotal = ΔG \nO\n—\n    and so ΔG \nO\n—\n    = ΔH \nO\n—\n    – TΔS \nO\n—\nsystem.\nGibbs free energy and spontaneous \nreactions\nFor a reaction to be spontaneous, ΔS \nO\n—\ntotal  must be \npositive. The value of T is always positive on the absolute \n(kelvin) temperature scale. So applying these signs to \nthe relationship ΔG \nO\n—\n    = –TΔS \nO\n—\ntotal, the value of ΔG must \nbe negative for a reaction to be spontaneous. So, when a \nspontaneous reaction occurs at constant temperature and \npressure, the Gibbs free energy decreases. If the value of \nΔG is positive, the reaction is not spontaneous.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nApplying the equation \nΔG O\n—  = ΔH O\n— – TΔS O\n— system\nWe can calculate the Gibbs free energy change for a \nreaction if we know:\n■\n■\nthe entropy change of the system in J K–1 mol–1\n■\n■\nthe enthalpy change of the system in J mol–1; we have to \nmultiply the value of the enthalpy change by 1000 because \nthe entropy change is in joules per kelvin per mol\n■\n■\nthe temperature; under standard conditions, this is 298 K.\nworked example\n7\t Calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the \ndecomposition of zinc carbonate at 298 K.\nZnCO3(s)  \n  ZnO(s)  +  CO2(g)\b ΔH O\n—\nr    = +71.0 kJ mol–1\n(Values for S O\n—\n     in J K–1 mol–1: CO2(g) = +213.6, \nZnCO3(s) = +82.4, ZnO(s) = +43.6)\nStep 1  Convert the value of ΔH O\n—\nr   to J mol–1:\n+71.0 × 1000 = 71 000 J mol–1\nStep 2  Calculate ΔS O\n—\nsystem:\nΔS O\n—\nsystem \t= S O\n—\nproducts – S O\n—\nreactants\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t \t = S O\n—\n     [ZnO(s)]  +  S O\n—\n     [CO2(g)] – S O\n—\n     [ZnCO3(s)]\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t \t = 43.6  +  213.6 – 82.4\n\t\nΔS O\n—\nsystem \t= +174.8 J K–1 mol–1\nStep 3  Calculate ΔG O\n—\n    :\nΔG O\n—\n     \t= ΔH O\n—\nreaction – TΔS O\n—\nsystem\n\t\n\t\n\t = 71 000 – 298 × (+174.8)\nΔG O\n—\n     \t= +18 909.6 J mol–1\n= +18.9 kJ mol–1 (to 3 significant figures)\nAs the value of ΔG O\n—\n     is positive, the reaction is not \nspontaneous at 298 K.\nQuestion\n8\t Calculate the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction \nin each of the following using the standard molar \nentropy values given.

The states are shown as \nstate symbols after each substance.\n\nComparing Gibbs free energy values\nTable 23.2 shows some values for some standard molar \nGibbs free energy changes of formation.\nYou learnt in Chapter 6 (page 92) that the standard \nenthalpy change of an element is zero. Similarly, the \nstandard Gibbs free energy change of formation of an \nelement is zero. Many compounds in the solid state \nhave high negative values of Gibbs free energy change of \nformation. Many gases and liquids have standard Gibbs \nfree energy change values that are negative but many \nothers, such as ethene, have positive values. The standard \nGibbs free energy change of formation also depends on  \nthe state. For example, ΔG \nO\n—\nf  [H2O(l)] is – 237.2 kJ mol–1 but \nΔG \nO\n—\nf  [H2O(g)] is – 228.6 kJ mol–1.\nGibbs free energy calculations\nGibbs free energy change of reaction\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction is \nthe Gibbs free energy change when the amounts of the \nreactants shown in the stoichiometric equation react under \nstandard conditions to give products. The reactants and \nproducts must be in their standard states.\nThe method of calculating Gibbs free energy change of \nreaction uses an energy cycle similar to the enthalpy cycles \nyou used to calculate the enthalpy change of reaction in \nChapter 6 (see Figure 23.8).\nΔG O\n—\nreaction\nreactants\nproducts\nΔG O\n—\n2\nΔG O\n—\n1\nelements in their\nstandard states\nFigure 23.8  A free energy cycle for calculating the standard \nGibbs free energy of reaction.
