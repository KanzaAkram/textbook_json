Other common carboxylic acids are citric acid, \nwhich gives citrus fruits their sharp taste, and ascorbic \nacid, which is the vitamin C in the same fruits.\nThe acidity of carboxylic acids\nCarboxylic acids display the typical reactions of all \nacids due to the presence of excess H+(aq) ions in their \naqueous solutions (see page 307). For example, they react \nwith bases to form a salt plus water. Their salts are called \ncarboxylates. The carboxylate salt formed by the reaction \nof ethanoic acid with sodium hydroxide is called sodium \nethanoate, CH3COO–Na+.\nThe carboxylic acids are weak acids. The majority of \ntheir molecules are undissociated in water. For example:\n394\nCH3COOH(aq)  \n  CH3COO–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\n\t\nethanoic acid\t\nethanoate ion\nThe position of this equilibrium lies well over to the left-hand \nside. The dissociation constant, Ka, of ethanoic acid at 25 °C is \n1.7 × 10–5 mol dm–3 (see page 308). Remember that the smaller \nthe value of Ka, the weaker the acid.\nThe carboxylic acids are stronger acids than alcohols.\n■\n■\nThe O   H bond in the carboxylic acid is weakened by the \ncarbonyl group, C   O.\nelectrons in the C—O bond\nare drawn towards the C——O bond\nO\nelectrons are drawn away\nfrom the O—H bond\nR\nC\nO\nH\n■\n■\nThe carboxylate ion is stabilised by the delocalisation of \nelectrons around the  COO– group. This delocalisation \nspreads out the negative charge on the carboxylate ion, \nreducing its charge density and making it less likely to bond \nwith an H+(aq) ion to re-form the undissociated  \nacid molecule.\nnegative charge is spread over\nthe whole      COO– group (the bond\nlengths of both carbon–oxygen\nbonds are equal)\nO\n–\nR\nC\nO\n\nFigure 26.1  Vinegar \ncontains about 7% \nethanoic acid – a \ncarboxylic acid.\nElectron-withdrawing groups bonded to the carbon atom \nnext to the  COOH group make the acid stronger. There \nare two reasons for this:\n■\n■\nelectron-withdrawing groups further weaken the O   H \nbond in the undissociated acid molecule\n■\n■\nelectron-withdrawing groups extend the delocalisation of \nthe negative charge on the  COO– group of the carboxylate \nion, further increasing the stabilising of the  COO– group \nand making it less likely to bond with an H+(aq) ion.\nChlorine atoms are an example of an electron-\nwithdrawing group. The dissociation constants of ethanoic \nacid and its three substituted chloro derivatives are shown \nin Table 26.1.\nAcid\nKa at 25 °C / mol dm–3\nethanoic acid, CH3COOH\n1.7 × 10–5\nchloroethanoic acid, CH2ClCOOH\n1.3 × 10–3\ndichloroethanoic acid, CHCl2COOH\n5.0 × 10–2\ntrichloroethanoic acid, CCl3COOH\n2.3 × 10–1\nTable 26.1  The larger the value of Ka, the stronger the acid.\nTrichloroethanoic acid, CCl3COOH, has three strongly \nelectronegative Cl atoms all withdrawing electrons from \nthe  COOH group, weakening the O — H bond more \nthan the other acids in Table 26.1. Once the O — H bond \nis broken, the resulting anion is also stabilised more \neffectively by its three electron-withdrawing Cl atoms, \nmaking it less attractive to H+(aq) ions. This makes the \nCCl3COOH the strongest of the acids listed in Table 26.1 \nas it has most Cl atoms (see Figure 26.2).\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nH\nweakest acid\n(Ka = 1.7 × 10–5 mol dm–3)\nO\nC\nH\nC\nH\nO\nH\nCl\nO\nC\nH\nC\nH\nO\nH\nCl\nO\nC\nCl\nC\nH\nO\nH\nCl\nO\nstrongest acid\n(Ka = 2.3 × 10–1 mol dm–3)\nC\nCl\nC\nCl\nO\nH\nthis H is lost most easily\nand the CCl3COO– ion\nformed is least attractive\nto H+(aq) ions\nFigure 26.2  The more electron-withdrawing groups on  \nthe C atom in the COOH group, the stronger the acid.\nEthanoic acid is the weakest acid in Table 26.1, as the \nmethyl group is electron donating. This has the opposite \neffect to electron-withdrawing groups:\n■\n■\nit strengthens the O   H bond in the acid’s  COOH group\n■\n■\nit donates negative charge towards the  COO– group of  \nthe carboxylate ion, making it more likely to accept an \nH+(aq) ion.\nQuestion\n1\t \u0007a\t \u0007Place the following acids in order of strength,  \nstarting with the strongest acid first.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007CH3CH2COOH      CH3CCl2COOH      CH3CHClCOOH\n\u0007b\t \u0007Explain why ethanoic acid is a stronger acid  \nthan ethanol.\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Predict which would be the stronger acid –  \nmethanoic acid or ethanoic acid – and explain  \nyour reasoning.\n\nChapter 26: Carboxylic acids and their derivatives\nOxidation of two carboxylic \nacids\nYou saw in Chapter 17 that primary alcohols can be \noxidised by acidified potassium dichromate(VI) solution \nto form aldehydes and then further oxidation produces \ncarboxylic acids (see page 236). The carboxylic acids \nprepared are not usually oxidised any further.\nHowever, methanoic acid (HCOOH) is a stronger \nreducing agent than other carboxylic acids, so it can \nundergo further oxidation.\nO\nH\nH\nC\nO\nFigure 26.3  The displayed formula of methanoic acid.\nThis involves the oxidising agent breaking down the \nmethanoic acid molecule, forming carbon dioxide. This \noxidation can be carried out even by warming with mild \noxidising agents (such as the Fehling’s or Tollens’ reagents \nused to distinguish between aldehydes and ketones – see \npage 239).\nIn a positive test for an aldehyde, the Cu2+ ion in \nFehling’s solution is reduced to the Cu+ ion, which \nprecipitates out as red copper(I) oxide. When methanoic \nacid is oxidised by Fehling’s solution, the same positive \ntest result is obtained. With Tollens’ reagent, the silver ion \npresent, Ag+, is reduced to silver metal when it oxidises \nmethanoic acid (also as in the positive test for  \nan aldehyde).\nThe half-equation for the oxidation of methanoic acid \ncan be written in terms of electron transfer to an oxidising \nagent as:\n395\noxidation\n\t\n        HCOOH  \n  CO2  +  2H+(aq)  +  2e–\noxidation number\t\n+2\t\n+4\nor in terms of the addition of oxygen from an oxidising \nagent as:\nHCOOH  +  [O]  \n  CO2  +  H2O\nThis oxidation of methanoic acid will also occur with \nstronger oxidising agents such as acidified solutions of \npotassium manganate(VII) – decolorising the purple \nsolution – or potassium dichromate(VI) – turning the \norange solution green.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nAnother common example of a carboxylic acid that can  \nbe oxidised by these stronger oxidising agents is \nethanedioic acid (a dicarboxylic acid). Its molecular \nformula is H2C2O4. Its structural formula is HOOCCOOH \nor (COOH)2, and its displayed formula is shown in  \nFigure 26.4.\nO\nO\nC\nH\nC\nO\nO\nH\nFigure 26.4  The displayed formula of ethanedioic acid.\nA solution of ethanedioic acid (with sulfuric acid added) \ncan be used in titrations to standardise a solution of \npotassium manganate(VII). As with methanoic acid, \nthe oxidation results in the formation of carbon dioxide \nand water. The solid ethanedioic acid can be weighed \nout accurately to make a standard solution of known \nconcentration. This is warmed in a conical flask and the \npotassium manganate(VII) solution to be standardised \nis run in from a burette. The end-point of the titration \nis identified when the addition of a drop of the purple \nmanganate(VII) solution turns the solution pink. This \nhappens when all the ethanedioic acid has been oxidised.\nThe balanced ionic equation for this redox reaction is:\n396\n2MnO4\n– + 6H+ + 5H2C2O4  \n 2Mn2+ + 10CO2 + 8H2O\nThe manganese(II) ions formed catalyse the reaction. \nThis is an example of autocatalysis, in which one of the \nproducts of the reaction acts as a catalyst for that reaction.\nQuestion\nNo special conditions are required for this reaction.\n2\t \u0007a\t \u0007Why is methanoic acid never prepared by  \nrefluxing methanol with acidified potassium \ndichromate(VI) solution?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Look back at the two half-equations for the \noxidation of methanoic acid.
