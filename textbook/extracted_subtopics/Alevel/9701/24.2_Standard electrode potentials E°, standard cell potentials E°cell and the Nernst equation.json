The mass of the anode \ndecreased by 0.45 g. Use this data to calculate the \ncharge on a mole of electrons.\n■\n■\nremove the cathode and anode and wash and dry \nthem with distilled water and then with propanone\n■\n■\nreweigh the cathode and anode.\nThe cathode increases in mass because copper is \ndeposited. The anode decreases in mass because \nthe copper goes into solution as copper ions. The \ndecrease in mass of the anode is measured. This is \npreferred because the copper does not always ‘stick’ \nto the cathode very well.\nA sample calculation is shown below, using a \ncurrent of 0.20 A for 34 min.\n■\n■\nmass of anode at start of the experiment = 56.53 g\n■\n■\nmass of anode at end of experiment = 56.40 g\n■\n■\nmass of copper removed from anode = 0.13 g\n■\n■\nquantity of charge passed Q\t = I × t\n\t\n= 0.20 × 34 × 60\n\t\n= 408 C\nTo deposit 0.13 g of copper requires 408 C,  \nso to deposit 1 mole of copper (63.5 g)\n278\nrequires ​ 63.5 \n____ \n0.13 ​ × 408 C\nBut the equation for the electrolysis shows that  \n2 moles of electrons are needed to produce 1 mole \nof copper:\nCu2+  +  2e–  \n  Cu\nThe charge on 1 mole of electrons\t = ​ 63.5 \n____ \n0.13 ​ × 408 × ​ 1 \n__ 2 ​\n= 99 600 C\nIf the charge on one electron is 1.60 × 10–19 C,\nL = ​ \n99 600 \n__________ \n1.60 × 10–19 ​ =  6.2 × 1023 mol–1 \n(to 2 significant figures)\nThis is in good agreement with the accurate value \nof 6.02 × 1023 mol–1.\n\nquestions\n(Ar value: [Ag] = 108)\n9\t An accurate value of the Faraday constant is \n96 485 C mol–1. An accurate value for the charge on \none electron is 1.6022 × 10–19 C. Use these values to \ncalculate a value of the Avogadro constant to \n5 significant figures.\nElectrode potentials\nIntroducing electrode potentials\nA redox equilibrium exists between two chemically related \nspecies that are in different oxidation states. For example, \nwhen a copper rod is placed in contact with an aqueous \nsolution of its ions the following equilibrium exists:\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Cu(s)\nThere are two opposing reactions in this equilibrium.\n■\n■\nMetal atoms from the rod entering the solution as metal \nions. This leaves electrons behind on the surface of the rod. \nFor example:\nCu(s)  \n  Cu2+(aq)  +  2e–\n■\n■\nIons in solution accepting electrons from the metal rod and \nbeing deposited as metal atoms on the surface of the rod. \nFor example:\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Cu(s)\nThe redox equilibrium is established when the rate of \nelectron gain equals the rate of electron loss.\nFor unreactive metals such as copper, if this \nequilibrium is compared with the equilibrium set up by \nother metals, the equilibrium set up by copper lies further \nover to the right.\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Cu(s)\nCu2+(aq) ions are therefore relatively easy to reduce. They \ngain electrons readily to form copper metal.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nFor reactive metals such as vanadium, the equilibrium \nlies further over to the left.\nV2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  V(s)\nV2+(aq) ions are therefore relatively difficult to reduce. \nThey gain electrons much less readily by comparison.\nThe position of equilibrium differs for different \ncombinations of metals placed in solutions of their ions.\nWhen a metal is put into a solution of its ions an electric \npotential (voltage) is established between the metal and the \nmetal ions in solution. We cannot measure this potential \ndirectly. But we can measure the difference in potential \nbetween the metal/metal ion system and another system. We \ncall this value the electrode potential, E. Electrode potential \nis measured in volts. The system we use for comparison is the \nstandard hydrogen electrode.\nIt is thought that the absolute electrical potentials \nthat we cannot measure are caused by the formation of \nan electrical double layer when an element is placed in a \nsolution of its ions. For example, when zinc is placed in a \nsolution containing zinc ions, a tiny number of zinc atoms \non the surface of the metal are converted to zinc ions, \nwhich go into solution. This leaves an excess of electrons \non the surface of the zinc. The solution around the metal \nnow has excess Zn2+ ions. Some of these cations near \nthe surface of the zinc are attracted to its surface. So an \nelectrical double layer is formed. This build up of charge \ncauses an electric potential (voltage) between the metal \nand the metal ions in solution (Figure 20.4).\n2+ = Zn2+ ions\nzinc rod\nZnSO4(aq)\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\nFigure 20.4  The separation of charge when a zinc rod is \nplaced in a solution of Zn2+ ions results in an electrical  \ndouble layer.\n\nChapter 20: Electrochemistry\nThe standard hydrogen electrode\nThe standard hydrogen electrode is one of several \ntypes of half-cell that can be used as reference \nelectrodes.

The \nplatinum electrode is inert so it does not take part \nin the reaction.\nStandard electrode potential E O\n— values for all \nhalf-cells are measured relative to this electrode. \nWhen connected to another half-cell, the value \nread on the voltmeter gives the standard electrode \npotential for that half-cell.\nThe half-equation for the hydrogen electrode can \nbe written:\n2H+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  H2(g)\nor\nH+(aq)  +  e–  \n  ​ 1 _ \n2 ​ H2(g)\nThe way that the half-equation is balanced makes \nno difference to the value of E O\n—.

So the electrons appear on the left-hand \nside of the half-equation. For example:\nAl3+(aq)  +  3e–  \n  Al(s)\n■\n■\nThe more positive (or less negative) the electrode potential, \nthe easier it is to reduce the ions on the left. So the metal \non the right is relatively unreactive and is a relatively poor \nreducing agent. For example:\nAg+(aq)  +  e–  \n  Ag(s)\b\nvoltage = +0.80 V\n■\n■\nThe more negative (or less positive) the electrode potential, \nthe more difficult it is to reduce the ions on the left. So the \nmetal on the right is relatively reactive and is a relatively \ngood reducing agent. For example:\nZn2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Zn(s)\b\nvoltage = –0.76 V\nCombining half-cells\nIn order to measure the electrode potential relating \nto the half-equation\n280\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Cu(s)\nwe place a pure copper rod in a solution of Cu2+(aq) \nions (for example copper(II) sulfate solution).

We can measure the voltage \nbetween these two half-cells. Figure 20.7 shows a \nCu2+/Cu half-cell connected to a Zn2+/Zn half-cell to \nmake a complete electrochemical cell.\nHalf-cells are connected together using:\n■\n■\nwires connecting the metal rods in each half-cell \nto a high-resistance voltmeter; the electrons flow \nround this external circuit from the metal with the \nmore negative (or less positive) electrode potential \nto the metal with the less negative (or more positive) \nelectrode potential\n■\n■\na salt bridge to complete the electrical circuit allowing \nthe movement of ions between the two half-cells so \nthat ionic balance is maintained; a salt bridge does not \nallow the movement of electrons.\nA salt bridge can be made from a strip of filter \npaper (or other inert porous material) soaked in a \nsaturated solution of potassium nitrate.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCombining half-cells (continued)\nThe voltages for the half-cells in Figure 20.7 can be \nrepresented by the following half-equations:\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Cu(s)\t\nvoltage = +0.34 V\nZn2+(aq)  +  2e–  \n  Zn(s)\t\nvoltage = –0.76 V\nThe relative values of these voltages tell us that  \nZn2+ ions are more difficult to reduce than Cu2+ ions. \nSo Cu2+ ions will accept electrons from the Zn2+/Zn \nhalf-cell and zinc will lose electrons to the Cu2+/Cu \nhalf-cell.\nHalf-equations can be used to show us the contents \nof half-cells. A half-cell does not have to be a  \nmetal/metal ion system. We can construct half-cells \nfor any half-equation written.

The \nvoltage generated by this cell is +1.10 V.\n281\nStandard electrode potential\nThe position of equilibrium of a reaction may be affected \nby changes in the concentration of reagents, temperature \nand pressure of gases. The voltage of an electrochemical \ncell will also depend on these factors, so we should use \nstandard conditions when comparing electrode potentials. \nThese are:\n■\n■\nconcentration of ions at 1.00 mol dm–3\n■\n■\na temperature of 25 °C (298 K)\n■\n■\nany gases should be at a pressure of 1 atmosphere (101 kPa)\n■\n■\nthe value of the electrode potential of the half-cell is \nmeasured relative to the standard hydrogen electrode.\nUnder these conditions, the electrode potential we \nmeasure is called the standard electrode potential. This \nhas the symbol, E \nO\n—\n   . It is spoken of as ‘E standard’.\nThe standard electrode potential for a half-cell is the \nvoltage measured under standard conditions with a \nstandard hydrogen electrode as the other half-cell.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nMeasuring standard electrode \npotentials\nThere are three main types of half-cell whose E \nO\n—\n    value  \ncan be obtained when connected to a standard  \nhydrogen electrode:\n■\n■\nmetal/metal ion half-cell\n■\n■\nnon-metal/non-metal ion half-cell\n■\n■\nion/ion half-cell.\nHalf-cells containing metals and  \nmetal ions\nFigure 20.8 shows how to measure the E \nO\n—\n    value for a \nCu2+/Cu half-cell. the Cu2+/Cu half-cell is connected to \na standard hydrogen electrode and the voltage measured. \nThe voltage is +0.34 V.

So the value of E becomes more positive / \nless negative.\nIf two different ions are present in the half-cell, we have \nto consider both ions.\nLet us take the equilibrium between Fe3+ ions and Fe2+ \nions as an example.\nFe3+  +  e–  \n  Fe2+\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.77 V\n1.00 mol dm–3\t\n1.00 mol dm–3\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\n■\n■\nIf [Fe3+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm –3  \n(keeping [Fe2+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes \nmore positive (for example +0.85 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Fe3+] is less than 1.00 mol dm–3  \n(keeping [Fe2+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes less \npositive (for example +0.70 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Fe2+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm–3  \n(keeping [Fe3+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes less \npositive (for example +0.70 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Fe2+] is less than 1.00 mol dm–3  \n(keeping [Fe3+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes \nmore positive (for example +0.85 V).\nYou can see from the above that if we increase the \nconcentration of both the Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions, these effects \nmay cancel each other out.\nHow can we predict whether or not a given reaction \nwill occur under non-standard conditions? The answer \nis that if the E \nO\n—\n    values of the two half-reactions involved \ndiffer by more than 0.30 V, then the reaction predicted by \nthe E \nO\n—\n    values is highly likely to occur. So chlorine is likely \nto oxidise Fe2+ ions even if the conditions are not standard. \nThis is because the difference in their E \nO\n—\n    values is 0.59 V, \nwhich is considerably greater than 0.30 V.\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2(g)  +  e–  \n  Cl– (aq)\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.36 V\nFe3+(aq)  +  e–  \n  Fe2+(aq)\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +0.77 V\nWe cannot, however, predict with confidence whether the \nreaction between MnO4\n– ions and Cl2 will take place if the \nconditions are too far from standard.\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e–  \n  Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.52 V\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2(g)  +  e–  \n  Cl–(aq)\b\nE \nO\n—\n    = +1.36 V\nThis is because the difference in E \nO\n—\n    values is 0.16 V, which \nis considerably smaller than 0.30 V.\nThe figure 0.30 V given here to enable us to tell if a \nreaction will still occur under non-standard conditions is a \nrough guide only. If E \nO\n—\n    values differ by less than 0.30 V, non-\nstandard conditions may result in an unexpected outcome.\n\nChapter 20: Electrochemistry\nQuestion\n26\t The half-cell\nCr2O7\n2–  +  14H+  +  6e–  \n  2Cr3+  +  7H2O\nhas an E O\n—\n     value of +1.33 V.\na\t \u0007Suggest how the value of E O\n—\n     changes if the other \nspecies are kept at 1.00 mol dm–3 but:\ni\t\n[Cr2O7\n2–] is increased\nii\t [H+] is decreased\niii\t [Cr3+] is increased.\nb\t \u0007What effect would each of these concentration \nchanges have on the strength of the acidified \nCr2O7\n2– solution as an oxidising agent?\nc\t\n\u0007What conditions would you use to make a solution \nof Cr2O7\n2– as strong an oxidising agent as possible?\nd\t \u0007Use Le Chatelier’s principle to explain your answer \nto part c.\n\u0007\nThe Nernst equation\nIf we consider a cell made up from a silver/silver ion \nelectrode and a copper/copper(II) ion electrode, the \nreaction taking place is:\n291\nCu(s)  +  2Ag+(aq)  \n  Cu2+(aq)  +  2Ag(s)\b E \nO\n—\n    = +0.46 V\nstandard conditions and change the concentration of the \nsilver ions, we obtain the graph shown in Figure 20.23. \nNote that we have plotted the value of Ecell (non-standard \nconditions for the cell as a whole) against the logarithm of \nthe silver ion concentration.\n0.5\n0.46 V\nE O\n—\ncell\n0.4\n0.3\nEcell / V\n0.2\n0.1\nlg [Ag+]\n–7\n–8\n0\n–6\n–5\n–4\n–3\n–2\n–1\n0\nFigure 20.23  Increasing the concentration of silver ions in the \ncell reaction Cu(s)  +  2Ag+(aq)  \n  Cu2+(aq)  +  2Ag(s) makes \nthe value of Ecell more positive.\n\n--- Page Break ---\n\nCambridge International A Level Chemistry\nThe effect of concentration and temperature on the value of \nEcell can be deduced using the Nernst equation.

It only tells \nus that a reaction is possible, and that the reverse reaction \ndoes not occur. Some reactions are feasible, but they \nproceed so slowly that they do not seem to be taking place. \nTake, for example, the lack of reactivity of zinc with cold \nwater.

It is the rate of reaction rather than the \nvalue of E \nO\n—\n    which is determining the lack of reactivity.\nquestions\n28\t An industrial process relies on a reaction that is \nimpractically slow under normal conditions.
