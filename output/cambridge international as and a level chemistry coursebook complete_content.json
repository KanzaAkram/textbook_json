          "content": "masses of atoms and molecules and how these are \nused in chemical calculations.\n2\nMasses of atoms and molecules\nRelative atomic mass, Ar\nAtoms of different elements have different masses. When \nwe perform chemical calculations, we need to know how \nheavy one atom is compared with another. The mass of \na single atom is so small that it is impossible to weigh it \ndirectly. To overcome this problem, we have to weigh a lot \nof atoms. We then compare this mass with the mass of the \nsame number of ‘standard’ atoms. Scientists have chosen \nto use the isotope carbon-12 as the standard. This has been \ngiven a mass of exactly 12 units. The mass of other atoms is \nfound by comparing their mass with the mass of carbon-12 \natoms. This is called the relative atomic mass, Ar.\nThe relative atomic mass is the weighted average mass of \nnaturally occurring atoms of an element on a scale where \nan atom of carbon-12 has a mass of exactly 12 units.\nFrom this it follows that:\nAr [element Y] \n\n---\n\nFigure 1.1  A titration is a method used to find the amount of \na particular substance in a solution.\nWe use the average mass of the atom of a particular element \nbecause most elements are mixtures of isotopes. For example, \nthe exact Ar of hydrogen is 1.0079. This is very close to 1 and \nmost periodic tables give the Ar of hydrogen as 1.0. However, \nsome elements in the Periodic Table have values that are not \nwhole numbers. For example, the Ar for chlorine is 35.5. This \nis because chlorine has two isotopes. In a sample of chlorine, \nchlorine-35 makes up about three-quarters of the chlorine \natoms and chlorine-37 makes up about a quarter.",

          "content": "Amount of substance\nThe mole and the Avogadro constant\nThe formula of a compound shows us the number of \natoms of each element present in one formula unit or one \nmolecule of the compound. In water we know that two \natoms of hydrogen (Ar = 1.0) combine with one atom of \noxygen (Ar = 16.0). So the ratio of mass of hydrogen atoms \nto oxygen atoms in a water molecule is 2 : 16. No matter \nhow many molecules of water we have, this ratio will \nalways be the same. But the mass of even 1000 atoms is \nfar too small to be weighed. We have to scale up much \nmore than this to get an amount of substance that is easy \nto weigh.\nThe relative atomic mass or relative molecular mass of \na substance in grams is called a mole of the substance. So a \nmole of sodium (Ar = 23.0) weighs 23.0 g. The abbreviation \nfor a mole is mol. We define the mole in terms of the \nstandard carbon-12 isotope (see page 28).\nOne mole of a substance is the amount of that substance \nthat has the same number of specific particles (atoms, \nmolecules or ions) as there are atoms in exactly 12 g of the \ncarbon-12 isotope.\n\n---\n\nWe often refer to the mass of a mole of substance as its \nmolar mass (abbreviation M). The units of molar mass \nare g mol–1.\nThe number of atoms in a mole of atoms is very large: \n6.02 × 1023 atoms. This number is called the Avogadro \nconstant (or Avogadro number). The symbol for the \nAvogadro constant is L (the symbol NA may also be used). \nThe Avogadro constant applies to atoms, molecules, ions \nand electrons. So in 1 mole of sodium there are 6.02 × 1023 \nsodium atoms and in 1 mole of sodium chloride (NaCl) there \nare 6.02 × 1023 sodium ions and 6.02 × 1023 chloride ions.\nIt is important to make clear what type of particles \nwe are referring to. If we just state ‘moles of chlorine’, it is \nnot clear whether we are thinking about chlorine atoms \nor chlorine molecules. A mole of chlorine molecules, Cl2, \ncontains 6.02 × 1023 chlorine molecules but twice as many \nchlorine atoms, as there are two chlorine atoms in every \nchlorine molecule.\n5\nFigure 1.7  Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856) was an Italian \nscientist who first deduced that equal volumes of gases \ncontain equal numbers of molecules. Although the Avogadro \nconstant is named after him, it was left to other scientists to \ncalculate the number of particles in a mole.\nMoles and mass\nThe Système International (SI) base unit for mass is the \nkilogram. But this is a rather large mass to use for general \nlaboratory work in chemistry. So chemists prefer to use \nthe relative molecular mass or formula mass in grams \n(1000 g = 1 kg). You can find the number of moles of a \nsubstance by using the mass of substance and the relative \natomic mass (Ar) or relative molecular mass (Mr).\nnumber of moles (mol) = ​  mass of substance in grams (g) \n__________________________ \nmolar mass (g mol–1) \n​",

          "content": "Mole calculations\nReacting masses\nWhen reacting chemicals together we may need to know \nwhat mass of each reactant to use so that they react exactly \nand there is no waste. To calculate this we need to know \nthe chemical equation. This shows us the ratio of moles \nof the reactants and products – the stoichiometry of the \nequation. The balanced equation shows this stoichiometry. \nFor example, in the reaction\nFe2O3  +  3CO \n 2Fe  +  3CO2\n1 mole of iron(III) oxide reacts with 3 moles of carbon \nmonoxide to form 2 moles of iron and 3 moles of carbon \ndioxide. The stoichiometry of the equation is 1 : 3 : 2 : 3. \nThe large numbers that are included in the equation \n(3, 2 and 3) are called stoichiometric numbers.\nIn order to find the mass of products formed in a \nchemical reaction we use:\n■\n■\nthe mass of the reactants\n■\n■\nthe molar mass of the reactants\n■\n■\nthe balanced equation.\n\nFigure 1.9  Iron reacting with sulfur to produce iron sulfide. \nWe can calculate exactly how much iron is needed to react \nwith sulfur and the mass of the products formed by \nknowing the molar mass of each reactant and the balanced \nchemical equation.\nworked example\n3\t Magnesium burns in oxygen to form magnesium oxide.\n2Mg  +  O2 \n 2MgO\nWe can calculate the mass of oxygen needed to react \nwith 1 mole of magnesium. We can calculate the mass \nof magnesium oxide formed.\nStep 1  Write the balanced equation.\nStep 2  Multiply each formula mass in g by the \nrelevant stoichiometric number in the equation.\n2Mg\t\n+\t\nO2\t\n2MgO\n\t 2 × 24.3 g\t\n\t 1 × 32.0 g\t\n2 × (24.3 g  +  16.0 g)\n48.6 g\t\n32.0 g\t\n80.6 g\nFrom this calculation we can deduce that:\n■\n■\n32.0 g of oxygen are needed to react exactly with \n48.6 g of magnesium\n■\n■\n80.6 g of magnesium oxide are formed.\nIf we burn 12.15 g of magnesium (0.5 mol) we get \n20.15 g of magnesium oxide. This is because the \nstoichiometry of the reaction shows us that for every \nmole of magnesium burnt we get the same number of \nmoles of magnesium oxide.\nIn this type of calculation we do not always need to know \nthe molar mass of each of the reactants. If one or more of \nthe reactants is in excess, we need only know the mass in \ngrams and the molar mass of the reactant that is not in \nexcess (the limiting reactant).\n\n---\n\nworked example\n4\t Iron(III) oxide reacts with carbon monoxide to form \niron and carbon dioxide.\nFe2O3  +  3CO \n 2Fe  +  3CO2\nCalculate the maximum mass of iron produced when \n798 g of iron(III) oxide is reduced by excess carbon \nmonoxide.\n(Ar values: Fe = 55.8, O = 16.0)\nStep 1\t Fe2O3  +  3CO \n 2Fe  +  3CO2\nStep 2\t 1 mole iron(III) oxide \t\n 2 moles iron\n(2 × 55.8) + (3 × 16.0) \t\n 2 × 55.8\n159.6 g Fe2O3 \t \t\n 111.6 g Fe\nStep 3\t 798 g\t\n​ 111.6 \n_____ \n159.6 ​ × 798\n= 558 g Fe\nYou can see that in step 3, we have simply used ratios \nto calculate the amount of iron produced from 798 g of \niron(III) oxide.\nquestion\n7\n5\t \u0007a\t \u0007Sodium reacts with excess oxygen to form sodium \nperoxide, Na2O2.\n2Na  +  O2 \n Na2O2\n\u0007Calculate the maximum mass of sodium \nperoxide formed when 4.60 g of sodium is burnt \nin excess oxygen.\n(Ar values: Na = 23.0, O = 16.0)\n\u0007b\t \u0007Tin(IV) oxide is reduced to tin by carbon.

Give your answer to 3 \nsignificant figures.\n(Ar values: C = 12.0, O = 16.0, Sn = 118.7)\nThe stoichiometry of a reaction\nWe can find the stoichiometry of a reaction if we know the \namounts of each reactant that exactly react together and \nthe amounts of each product formed.\nFor example, if we react 4.0 g of hydrogen with 32.0 g of \noxygen we get 36.0 g of water.

So the equation is:\n2H2  +  O2 \n 2H2O\nWe can still deduce the stoichiometry of this reaction \neven if we do not know the mass of oxygen that reacted. \nThe ratio of hydrogen to water is 1 : 1. But there is only one \natom of oxygen in a molecule of water – half the amount \nin an oxygen molecule. So the mole ratio of oxygen to \nwater in the equation must be 1 : 2.\nQuestion\n6\t \u000756.2 g of silicon, Si, reacts exactly with 284.0 g of \nchlorine, Cl2, to form 340.2 g of silicon(IV) chloride, \nSiCl4.

The examples show \nthe number 526.84 rounded up to varying numbers of \nsignificant figures.\nrounded to 4 significant figures = 526.8\nrounded to 3 significant figures = 527\nrounded to 2 significant figures = 530\nWhen you are writing an answer to a calculation, the \nanswer should be to the same number of significant figures \nas the least number of significant figures in the data.\nworked example\n5\t How many moles of calcium oxide are there in 2.9 g of \ncalcium oxide?\n(Ar values: Ca = 40.1, O = 16.0)\nIf you divide 2.9 by 56.1, your calculator shows \n0.051 693 …. The least number of significant figures \nin the data, however, is 2 (the mass is 2.9 g). So your \nanswer should be expressed to 2 significant figures, \nas 0.052 mol.\n\n---\n\nworked example (continued)\nNote 1  Zeros before a number are not significant \nfigures.

The formula of an ionic compound is determined by \nthe charges on each of the ions present. The number of positive \ncharges is balanced by the number of negative charges so that \nthe total charge on the compound is zero. We can work out the \nformula for a compound if we know the charges on the ions. \nFigure 1.11 shows the charges on some simple ions related to \nthe position of the elements in the Periodic Table. The form \nof the Periodic Table that we shall be using has 18 groups \nbecause the transition elements are numbered as Groups \n3 to 12. So, aluminium is in Group 13 and chlorine is in \nGroup 17.\nFor simple metal ions in Groups 1 and 2, the value of \nthe positive charge is the same as the group number.

However, there \nare many exceptions to these rules.\nCompounds containing a simple metal ion and non-\nmetal ion are named by changing the end of the name of \nthe non-metal element to -ide.\n11\nsodium + chlorine \n sodium chloride\nzinc + sulfur \n zinc sulfide\nCompound ions containing oxygen are usually called \n-ates.

So there must be the same number of each \ntype of atom on the reactants side of a chemical equation \nas there are on the products side. A symbol equation is a \nshorthand way of describing a chemical reaction. It shows \nthe number and type of the atoms in the reactants and the \nnumber and type of atoms in the products. If these are \nthe same, we say the equation is balanced. Follow these \nexamples to see how we balance an equation.\nworked examples\n13\t Balancing an equation\nStep 1  Write down the formulae of all the reactants and \nproducts.

The solvent is usually water. There \nare 1000 cm3 in a cubic decimetre. When 1 mole of a \n\n---\n\ncompound is dissolved to make 1 dm3 of solution the \nconcentration is 1 mol dm–3.\nconcentration (mol dm–3) \n = ​ number of moles of solute (mol) \n___________________________ \nvolume of solution (dm3) \n​\nWe use the terms ‘concentrated’ and ‘dilute’ to refer to the \nrelative amount of solute in the solution. A solution with a \nlow concentration of solute is a dilute solution. If there is a \nhigh concentration of solute, the solution is concentrated.\nWhen performing calculations involving \nconcentrations in mol dm–3 you need to:\n■\n■\nchange mass in grams to moles\n■\n■\nchange cm3 to dm3 (by dividing the number of cm3 by 1000).\nworked example\n18\t Calculate the concentration in mol dm–3 of sodium \nhydroxide, NaOH, if 250 cm3 of a solution contains 2.0 g \nof sodium hydroxide.\n(Mr value: NaOH = 40.0)\nStep 1\t Change grams to moles.\n​ 2.0 \n____ \n40.0 ​ = 0.050 mol NaOH\nStep 2\t Change cm3 to dm3.\n250 cm3 = ​ 250 \n_____ \n1000 ​ dm3 = 0.25 dm3\nStep 3\t Calculate concentration.\n​ 0.050 (mol) \n__________ \n0.25 (dm3) ​ = 0.20 mol dm–3\nFigure 1.14  The concentration of chlorine in the water in a \nswimming pool must be carefully controlled.\n\nWe often need to calculate the mass of a substance present \nin a solution of known concentration and volume.

As they pass through the metal \nplates the electrons form a beam. When the electron \nbeam hits the screen a spot of light is produced. \nWhen an electric field is applied across this beam \nthe electrons are deflected (bent).

          "content": "Evidence for electronic structure\nIonisation energy, ΔHi\nBy firing high-speed electrons at atoms, scientists can \nwork out how much energy has to be supplied to form an \nion by knocking out one electron from each atom.\nThe energy change that accompanies this process is \ncalled the ionisation energy.\n34\n\n---\n\nThe 1st ionisation energy of an element is the energy \nneeded to remove one electron from each atom in one \nmole of atoms of the element in the gaseous state to form \none mole of gaseous 1+ ions.\nIonisation energies are measured under standard \nconditions. The general symbol for ionisation energy is \nΔHi. Its units are kJ mol–1.\nThe symbol for the 1st ionisation energy is ΔHi1. Using \ncalcium as an example:\n1st ionisation energy: Ca(g) \n Ca+(g)  +  e–\nΔHi1 = 590 kJ mol–1\nIf a second electron is removed from each ion in a mole of \ngaseous 1+ ions, we call it the 2nd ionisation energy, ΔHi2. \nAgain, using calcium as an example:\n2nd ionisation energy: Ca+(g) \n Ca2+(g)  +  e–\nΔHi2 = 1150 kJ mol–1\nRemoval of a third electron from each ion in a mole of \ngaseous 2+ ions is called the 3rd ionisation energy. Again, \nusing calcium as an example:\n3rd ionisation energy: Ca2+(g) \n Ca3+(g)  +  e–\nΔHi3 = 4940 kJ mol–1\nWe can continue to remove electrons from an atom until \nonly the nucleus is left. We call this sequence of ionisation \nenergies, successive ionisation energies.\nThe successive ionisation energies for the first 11 \nelements in the Periodic Table are shown in Table 3.2.\nThe data in Table 3.2 shows us that:\n■\n■\nFor each element, the successive ionisation energies \nincrease. This is because the charge on the ion gets \ngreater as each electron is removed. As each electron is \nremoved there is a greater attractive force between the \npositively charged protons in the nucleus and the remaining \nnegatively charged electrons. Therefore more energy is \nneeded to overcome these attractive forces.\n■\n■\nThere is a big difference between some successive \nionisation energies. For nitrogen this occurs between \nthe 5th and 6th ionisation energies. For sodium the first \nbig difference occurs between the 1st and 2nd ionisation \nenergies. These large changes indicate that for the second \nof these two ionisation energies the electron being removed \nis from a principal quantum shell closer to the nucleus.\n\n1\nH\n1 310\n 2\nHe\n2 370\n5 250\n 3\nLi\n 519\n7 300\n11 800\n 4\nBe\n 900\n1 760\n14 850\n21 000\n 5\nB\n 799\n2 420\n 3 660\n25 000\n32 800\n 6\nC\n 1 090\n2 350\n 4 620\n 6 220\n37 800\n47 300\n 7\nN\n 1 400\n2 860\n 4 580\n 7 480\n 9 450\n53 300\n64 400\n 8\nO\n 1 310\n3 390\n 5 320\n 7 450\n11 000\n13 300\n71 300\n84 100\n 9\nF\n 1 680\n3 370\n 6 040\n 8 410\n11 000\n15 200\n17 900\n92 000\n106 000\n10\nNe\n 2 080\n3 950\n 6 150\n 9 290\n12 200\n15 200\n20 000\n23 000\n117 000\n131 400\nTable 3.2  Successive ionisation energies for the first 11 elements in the Periodic Table.\n2\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write equations that describe:\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007the 1st ionisation energy of calcium\n\u0007ii\t \u0007the 3rd ionisation energy of potassium\n\u0007iii\t \u0007the 2nd ionisation energy of lithium\n\u0007iv\t \u0007the 5th ionisation energy of sulfur.\n\u0007b\t \u0007The 2nd ionisation energy of nitrogen is \n2860 kJ mol–1. The 3rd ionisation energy of \nnitrogen is 4590 kJ mol–1. Explain why the 3rd \nionisation energy is higher.\nThree factors that influence ionisation \nenergies\n1  The size of the nuclear charge\nAs the atomic number (number of protons) increases, the \npositive nuclear charge increases. The bigger the positive \ncharge, the greater the attractive force between the nucleus \nand the electrons. So, more energy is needed to overcome \nthese attractive forces if an electron is to be removed.\n■\n■\nIn general, ionisation energy increases as the proton \nnumber increases.\n\n---\n\nElectrons removed\nElement\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n11\nNa\n  494\n4 560\n 6 940\n 9 540\n13 400\n16 600\n20 100\n25 500\n 28 900\n141 000\n158 700\n2  Distance of outer electrons from the \nnucleus\nThe force of attraction between positive and negative \ncharges decreases rapidly as the distance between them \nincreases. So, electrons in shells further away from the \nnucleus are less attracted to the nucleus than those closer \nto the nucleus.\nQuestion\n35\n■\n■\nThe further the outer electron shell is from the nucleus, the \nlower the ionisation energy.\n3  Shielding effect of inner electrons\nAs all electrons are negatively charged, they repel each \nother. Electrons in full inner shells repel electrons in outer \nshells. Full inner shells of electrons prevent the full nuclear \ncharge being felt by the outer electrons. This is called \nshielding. The greater the shielding of outer electrons by \nthe inner electron shells, the lower the attractive forces \nbetween the nucleus and the outer electrons.\n■\n■\nThe ionisation energy is lower as the number of full \nelectron shells between the outer electrons and the \nnucleus increases.\n\nInterpreting successive ionisation \nenergies\nFigure 3.4 shows a graph of successive ionisation \nenergies against the number of electrons removed for \nsodium. A logarithmic scale (to the base 10) is used \nbecause the values of successive ionisation energies have \nsuch a large range.\n5\nlog10 ionisation energy /kJmol–1\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10 11\nNumber of electrons removed\n36\nFigure 3.4  Graph of logarithm (log10) of ionisation energy of \nsodium against the number of electrons removed.\nWe can deduce the following about sodium from \nFigure 3.4:\n■\n■\nThe first electron removed has a low 1st ionisation energy, \nwhen compared with the rest of the data. It is very easily \nremoved from the atom. It is therefore likely to be a long way \nfrom the nucleus and well shielded by inner electron shells.\n■\n■\nThe second electron is much more difficult to remove than \nthe first electron. There is a big jump in the value of the \nionisation energy. This suggests that the second electron is \nin a shell closer to the nucleus than the first electron. Taken \ntogether, the 1st and 2nd ionisation energies suggest that \nsodium has one electron in its outer shell.\n■\n■\nFrom the second to the ninth electrons removed there is \nonly a gradual change in successive ionisation energies. This \nsuggests that all these eight electrons are in the same shell.\n■\n■\nThe 10th and 11th electrons have extremely high ionisation \nenergies, when compared with the rest of the data. This \nsuggests that they are very close to the nucleus. There must \nbe a very great force of attraction between the nucleus and \nthese electrons and there are no inner electrons to shield \nthem. The large increase in ionisation energy between the \n9th and 10th electrons confirms that the 10th electron is in a \nshell closer to the nucleus than the 9th electron.\n\n---\n\n1 electron;\nvery easily\nremoved\n2 electrons;\nvery difficult\nto remove\n8 electrons;\nless easily\nremoved\n11+\nnucleus\nFigure 3.5  The arrangement of electrons in an atom of \nsodium can be deduced from the values of successive \nionisation energies.\nQuestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007The successive ionisation energies of boron are \nshown in Table 3.3.\nIonisation\n1st \n2nd \n3rd \n4th \n5th \nIonisation energy / \nkJ mol–1\n799\n2 420 3 660 25 000 32 800\nTable 3.3  Successive ionisation energies of boron.\ni\t\n\u0007Why is there a large increase between the third \nand fourth ionisation energies?\n\u0007ii\t \u0007Explain how these figures confirm that the \nelectronic structure of boron is 2, 3.\n\u0007b\t \u0007For the element aluminium (Z = 13), draw a \nsketch graph to predict the log10 of the successive \nionisation energies (y-axis) against the number of \nelectrons removed (x-axis).\nWe can use successive ionisation energies in this way to:\n■\n■\npredict or confirm the simple electronic configuration \nof elements\n■\n■\nconfirm the number of electrons in the outer shell of an \nelement and hence the group to which the element belongs.\nworked example\n1\t The successive ionisation energies, ΔHi, of an element \nX are shown in Table 3.4.

          "content": "Patterns in ionisation energies \nin the Periodic Table\nPatterns across a period\nFigure 3.13 shows how the first ionisation energy, ΔHi1, \nchanges across the first two periods. We can explain the \nform of the graph mainly by referring to the factors that \ninfluence ionisation energies (see page 35).\nNe\nHe\n2500\nFirst ionisation energy /kJ mol–1\n2000\nN\nF\n1500\nBe\nC\nO\nH\n1000\nB\n500\nLi\nNa\n0\n0\n5\nAtomic number (Z)\n10\nFigure 3.13  A graph of the first ionisation energies of the \nelements hydrogen to sodium plotted against atomic number.\n41\n1\t There is a general increase in ΔHi1 across a period. This \napplies to Period 1 (hydrogen and helium), Period 2 \n(lithium to neon) and also to other periods. As you go \nacross a period the nuclear charge increases. But the \nelectron removed comes from the same shell. So, the \nforce of attraction between the positive nucleus and the \nouter negative electrons increases across the \nperiod because:\ni\t\nthe nuclear charge increases\nii\t \u0007the distance between the nucleus and the outer \nelectron remains reasonably constant\niii\t \u0007the shielding by inner shells remains \nreasonably constant.\n2\t There is a rapid decrease in ionisation energy between \nthe last element in one period and the first element in \nthe next period. The ΔHi1 for lithium is much smaller \nthan the ΔHi1 for helium. Helium has two electrons. \nThese are in the first quantum shell. But lithium has \nthree electrons. The third electron must go into the \nnext quantum shell further away from the nucleus. So, \nthe force of attraction between the positive nucleus and \nthe outer negative electrons decreases because:\n\ni\t\nthe distance between the nucleus and the outer \nelectron increases\nii\t the shielding by inner shells increases\niii\t these two factors outweigh the increased nuclear charge.\n3\t There is a slight decrease in ΔHi1 between beryllium \nand boron. Although boron has one more proton than \nberyllium, there is a slight decrease in ΔHi1 on removal \nof the outer electron. Beryllium has the electronic \nstructure 1s2 2s2 and boron has the electronic \nstructure 1s2 2s2 2p1. The fifth electron in boron must \nbe in the 2p subshell, which is slightly further away \nfrom the nucleus than the 2s subshell. There is less \nattraction between the fifth electron in boron and the \nnucleus because:\ni\t\nthe distance between the nucleus and the outer \nelectron increases slightly\nii\t the shielding by inner shells increases slightly\niii\t these two factors outweigh the increased \nnuclear charge.\n4\t There is a slight decrease in ΔHi1 between nitrogen \nand oxygen. Oxygen has one more proton than \nnitrogen and the electron removed is in the same 2p \nsubshell. So, you might think that ΔHi1 would \nincrease. However, the spin-pairing of the electrons \nplays a part here. If you look back at Figure 3.12, you \nwill see that the electron removed from the nitrogen \nis from an orbital that contains an unpaired electron. \nThe electron removed from the oxygen is from the \norbital that contains a pair of electrons. The extra \nrepulsion between the pair of electrons in this orbital \nresults in less energy being needed to remove an \nelectron. So, ΔHi1 for oxygen is lower, because of \nspin-pair repulsion.\n42\nThese patterns repeat themselves across the third period. \nHowever, the presence of the d-block elements in Period 4 \ndisrupts the pattern, as d-block elements have first \nionisation energies that are relatively similar and fairly high.\n\n---\n\nPatterns down a group\nThe first ionisation energy decreases as you go down a \ngroup in the Periodic Table. For example, in Group 1 the \nvalues of ΔHi1 are:\n■\n■\nLi = 519 kJ mol–1\n■\n■\nNa = 494 kJ mol–1\n■\n■\nK = 418 kJ mol–1\n■\n■\nRb = 403 kJ mol–1\nAs you go down the group, the outer electron removed \nis from the same type of orbital but from a successively \nhigher principal quantum level – 2s from lithium, 3s \nfor sodium and 4s for potassium. Although the nuclear \ncharge is increasing down the group there is less attraction \nbetween the outer electron and the nucleus because:\n1\t the distance between the nucleus and the outer \nelectron increases\n2\t the shielding by complete inner shells increases\n3\t these two factors outweigh the increased nuclear charge.\nQuestion\n10\t \u0007a\t \u0007The first ionisation energies of four consecutive \nelements in the Periodic Table are:\nsodium = 494 kJ mol–1\nmagnesium = 736 kJ mol–1\naluminium = 577 kJ mol–1\nsilicon = 786 kJ mol–1\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007Explain the general increase in ionisation \nenergies from sodium to silicon.\n\u0007ii\t \u0007Explain why aluminium has a lower first \nionisation energy than magnesium.\n\u0007b\t \u0007The first ionisation energy of fluorine is \n1680 kJ mol–1 whereas the first ionisation energy of \niodine is 1010 kJ mol–1. Explain why fluorine has a \nhigher first ionisation energy than iodine despite it \nhaving a smaller nuclear charge.\n\nSummary\n■\t Electrons in an atom can exist only in certain energy \nlevels (shells) outside the nucleus.\n■\t The main energy levels (shells) are given principal \nquantum numbers n = 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. The lowest \nenergy level (n = 1) is closest to the nucleus.\n■\t The shells may be divided into subshells known \nas s, p and d subshells, which can hold a maximum \nof 2, 6 and 10 electrons, respectively.\n■\t The region of space in which an electron is likely to \nbe found is called an orbital. Each subshell has a \nnumber of orbitals which can each hold a maximum \nof two electrons. Subshells s, p and d have 1, 3 and 5 \norbitals, respectively.\n■\t The s orbitals are spherical in shape. The p orbitals \nhave two ‘lobes’.\n■\t When two electrons are present in an orbital they \nspin in opposite directions and are said to be paired.\n■\t The electronic configuration of atoms is found by \nadding electrons to each orbital starting from those \nin the lowest energy level.\n■\t When electrons are added to orbitals in the same \nsubshell they go into separate orbitals if possible. \nElectrons pair up where this is not possible.\n\n---\n\n■\t The 1st ionisation energy of an element is the energy \nneeded to remove one electron from each atom in \none mole of atoms of the element in the gaseous \nstate (to form gaseous 1+ ions).\n■\t The ionisation energies needed to remove the first, \nsecond, third, fourth, etc., electrons from each \natom or ion in a mole of gaseous atoms are called \nsuccessive ionisation energies.\n■\t The magnitude of the ionisation energy depends on \nthese four factors:\n–\t \u0007the distance of the electron from the nucleus\n–\t \u0007the number of positive charges in the nucleus\n–\t \u0007the degree of shielding of outer electrons by \ninner electron shells\n–\t \u0007spin-pair repulsion.\n■\t The trends in 1st ionisation energy of the elements \nacross a period and down a group can be explained \nusing the four factors above.\n■\t Values of successive ionisation energies of atoms \nprovide evidence for their electronic configuration.\n43\n\nEnd-of-chapter questions\n1 The sketch graph shows the 13 successive ionisation energies of aluminium.\nlog10 ionisation energy\n1\n0\n0\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nNumber of electrons removed\na Define the term 1st ionisation energy. \n[3]\nb How does the graph provide evidence for the existence of three electron shells in an aluminium atom? \n[6]\nc \n Write an equation, including state symbols, to represent the 2nd ionisation energy of aluminium. \n[2]\nd Write the electronic configuration of an aluminium ion, Al3+, using 1s2 notation. \n[1]\nTotal = 12\n2 The table below shows the 1st ionisation energies, ΔHi1, in kJ mol–1, of the elements in Period 3 of the Periodic Table.\n44\nElement\nNa\nMg\nAl\nSi\nP\nS\nCl\nAr\nΔHi1\n494\n736\n577\n786\n1060\n1000\n1260\n1520\na Explain why there is a general increase in the value of ΔHi1 across the period. \n[4]\nb Explain why aluminium has a lower value of ΔHi1 than magnesium. \n[4]\nc \n Write the electronic configuration for argon (Z = 18) using 1s2 notation. \n[1]\nd Copy and complete the diagram below for the 15 electrons in phosphorus by\ni \n adding labels for the other subshells \n[1]\nii showing how the electrons are arranged. \n[3]\n1s\ne Predict a value for the 1st ionisation energy for potassium, which has one more proton than argon. \n[1]\nTotal = 14\n\n---\n\n8\n9 10 11 12 13\n\n3 a What do you understand by the term atomic orbital? \n[1]\nb Draw diagrams to show the shape of:\ni \n an s orbital \n[1]\nii a p orbital. \n[1]\nc \n Element x has the electronic configuration 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d8 4s2.\ni \n Which block in the Periodic Table does element x belong to? \n[1]\nii State the maximum number of electrons in a d subshell. \n[1]\niii Element x forms an ion of type x2+.\n Write the full electronic configuration for this ion using 1s2 notation. \n[1]\niv Write the symbol for the subshell that begins to fill after the 3d and 4s are completely full. \n[1]\nTotal = 7\n4 The 1st ionisation energies of several elements with consecutive atomic numbers are shown in the graph below. \nThe letters are not the symbols of the elements.\n2000\nFirst ionisation energy /kJmol–1\n1600\n1200\n1800\n400\n0\nA\nB\nC\nD\na Which of the elements a to i belong to Group 1 in the Periodic Table?

          "content": "Metallic bonding\nWhat is a metallic bond?\n\nIn a metal, the atoms are packed closely together in a \nregular arrangement called a lattice. Metal atoms in a \nlattice tend to lose their outer shell electrons and become \npositive ions. The outer shell electrons occupy new energy \nlevels and are free to move throughout the metal lattice. \nWe call these electrons delocalised electrons (mobile \nelectrons). Delocalised electrons are electrons that are not \nassociated with any one particular atom or bond.\nMetallic bonding is strong. This is because the ions \nare held together by the strong electrostatic attraction \nbetween their positive charges and the negative charges of \nthe delocalised electrons (Figure 4.29). This electrostatic \nattraction acts in all directions. The strength of metallic \nbonding increases with:\n■\n■\nincreasing positive charge on the ions in the metal lattice\n■\n■\ndecreasing size of metal ions in the lattice\n■\n■\nincreasing number of mobile electrons per atom.\nMetallic bonding and the properties of \nmetals\nWe can use our model of metallic bonding to explain \nmany of the properties of metals.\nMost metals have high melting points and \nhigh boiling points\nIt takes a lot of energy to weaken the strong attractive \nforces between the metal ions and the delocalised \nelectrons.

For Groups 1 to 17 the pattern of \nelectronegativity is:\n■\n■\nelectronegativity increases across a period from Group 1 to \nGroup 17\n■\n■\nelectronegativity increases up each group.\nThis means that fluorine is the most electronegative \nelement.\nFor the most electronegative elements, the order of \nelectronegativity is:\nincreasing electronegativity\nBr < Cl < N < O < F\nCarbon and hydrogen have electronegativities that are \nlower than those of most other non-metallic elements.\n\nAs a result:\n■\n■\nthe centre of positive charge does not coincide with the \ncentre of negative charge\n■\n■\nwe say that the electron distribution is asymmetric\n■\n■\nthe two atoms are partially charged\n■\n■\nwe show\n–\t\nthe less electronegative atom with the partial charge δ+ \n(‘delta positive’)\n–\t\nthe more electronegative atom with the partial charge \nδ– (‘delta negative’)\n■\n■\nwe say that the bond is polar (or that it has a dipole).\nFigure 4.32 shows the polar bond in a hydrogen \nchloride molecule.\nCl\nH\nδ+\nδ–\nFigure 4.32  Hydrogen chloride is a polar molecule.\nAs the difference in electronegativity values of the atoms \nin a covalent bond increases, the bond becomes more \npolar. The degree of polarity of a molecule is measured as a \ndipole moment. The direction of the dipole is shown by the \nsign \n. The arrow points to the partially negatively \ncharged end of the dipole.\nIn molecules containing more than two atoms, we have \nto take into account:\n■\n■\nthe polarity of each bond\n■\n■\nthe arrangement of the bonds in the molecule.\nTrichloromethane, CHCl3, is a polar molecule. The \nthree C   Cl dipoles point in a similar direction. Their \ncombined effect is not cancelled out by the polarity of the \nC   H bond. This is because the C   H bond is virtually \nnon-polar. The electron distribution is asymmetric. The \nmolecule is polar, with the negative end towards the \nchlorine atoms.

This is because the polar bonds in these molecules \nare arranged in such a fashion that the dipole moments \n\n---\n\ncancel each other out. An example is tetrachloromethane, \nCCl4 (Figure 4.33b). Tetrachloromethane has four polar \nC   Cl bonds pointing towards the four corners of a \ntetrahedron. The dipoles in each bond cancel each other. \nSo, tetrachloromethane is non-polar.\nThe charge distribution in molecules and ions can be \ndetermined by a method called X-ray spectroscopy. One \nmethod involves firing X-rays at molecules and measuring \nthe energy of the electrons given off. Using this method, \nscientists have found that in a sulfate ion, the sulfur atom \nhas a charge of +1.12 units and the four oxygen atoms each \nhave a charge of –0.78 units.\nQuestion\n9\t \u0007Are the following molecules polar or non-polar?

For example, \nboth nitrogen, N   N, and carbon monoxide, C   O, have \ntriple bonds requiring a similar amount of energy to \nbreak them. Nitrogen is a non-polar molecule and is fairly \nunreactive. But carbon monoxide is a polar molecule, and \nthis explains its reactivity with oxygen and its use as a \nreducing agent. Many chemical reactions are started by a \nreagent attacking one of the electrically charged ends of a \npolar molecule. For example, chloroethane, C2H5Cl, is far \nmore reactive than ethane, C2H6. This is because reagents \nsuch as OH– ions can attack the delta-positive carbon atom \nof the polarised C   Cl bond (see also page 220).\nH\nH\nC\nH\nCl\nδ+\nδ–\nC\nH\nH\nSuch an attack is not possible with ethane because the \nC   H bond is virtually non-polar. This helps to explain \nwhy alkanes, such as ethane, are not very reactive.\n\nvan der Waals’ forces\nNoble gases such as neon and argon exist as isolated atoms. \nNoble gases can be liquefied, but at very low temperatures, \nso there must be very weak forces of attraction between \ntheir atoms. These weak forces keep the atoms together in \nthe liquid state.\nBromine is a non-polar molecule that is liquid at \nroom temperature. The weak forces of attraction are \nkeeping the bromine molecules together at room \ntemperature. These very weak forces of attraction are \ncalled van der Waals’ forces. van der Waals’ forces exist \nbetween all atoms or molecules. So, how do van der \nWaals’ forces arise?\nThe electron charge clouds in a non-polar molecule \n(or atom) are constantly moving. It often happens that \nmore of the charge cloud is on one side of the molecule \nthan the other. This means that one end of the molecule \nhas, for a short moment, more negative charge than the \nother. A temporary dipole is set up. This dipole can set up \n(induce) a dipole on neighbouring molecules. As a result \nof this, there are forces of attraction between the δ+ end \nof the dipole in one molecule and the δ– end of the dipole \nin a neighbouring molecule (Figure 4.34). These dipoles \nare always temporary because the electrons clouds are \nalways moving. van der Waals’ forces are sometimes called \ntemporary dipole–induced dipole forces.\nvan der Waals’ forces increase with\n62\n■\n■\nincreasing number of electrons (and protons) in the molecule\n■\n■\nincreasing the number of contact points between the \nmolecules – contact points are places where the molecules \ncome close together.\nDifferences in the size of the van der Waals’ forces can \nbe used to explain the trend in the enthalpy change of \nvaporisation and boiling points of the noble gases.

This is because the van \nder Waals’ forces between the atoms are increased with \nan increasing number of electrons. So, more energy is \nneeded to change the liquid into vapour and the boiling \npoint is higher.\nThe effect of increasing the number of contact points \ncan be seen by comparing the boiling points of pentane \n(boiling point 36 °C) and 2,2-dimethylpropane (boiling \npoint 10 °C) (Figure 4.36). These compounds have equal \nnumbers of electrons in their molecules.\nThe molecules in pentane can line up beside each other \nso there are a large number of contact points. The van der \nWaals’ forces are higher, so the boiling point is higher. \nThe molecules of 2,2-dimethylpropane are more compact. \nThe surface area available for coming into contact with \nneighbouring molecules is smaller. The van der Waals’ \nforces are relatively lower, so the boiling point is lower.\nThe van der Waals’ forces between individual atoms are very \nsmall. However, the total van der Waals’ forces between very \nlong non-polar molecules such as poly(ethene) molecules (see \npage 211) can be much larger. That is why poly(ethene) is a \nsolid at room temperature.\nXe\nKr\n40\n0\n20\n60\n\nCH3\nCH2\nCH3\nCH2\nCH2\nCH3\nCH2\nCH3\nCH2\nCH2\nCH3\npentane,\nboiling point 36 °C\nTwo types of poly(ethene) are low-density poly(ethene), \nLDPE, and high-density poly(ethene), HDPE.

Molecules \nwith a permanent dipole are called polar molecules. A \nfine jet of polar molecules will be attracted towards an \nelectrically charged plastic rod or comb. (The rod can be \ncharged by rubbing it with a woollen cloth.) Figure 4.38 \nshows the result of this experiment.\nThe molecules are always attracted to the charged \nrod, whether it is positively or negatively charged. This is \nbecause the molecules have both negatively and positively \ncharged ends.\nThe forces between two molecules having permanent \ndipoles are called permanent dipole–dipole forces. \nThe attractive force between the δ+ charge on one \nmolecule and the δ– charge on a neighbouring \nmolecule causes a weak attractive force between the \nmolecules (Figure 4.39).\n63",

For hydrogen bonding to occur between two \nmolecules we need:\n■\n■\none molecule having a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to \nF, O or N (the three most electronegative atoms)\n\n---\n\nWhen a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to a very \nelectronegative atom, the bond is very highly polarised. \nThe δ+ charge on the hydrogen atom is high enough for \na bond to be formed with a lone pair of electrons on the \nF, O or N atom of a neighbouring molecule (Figure 4.41). \nThe force of attraction is about one-tenth of the strength \nof a normal covalent bond. For maximum bond strength, \nthe angle between the covalent bond to the hydrogen atom \nand the hydrogen bond is usually 180°.\nH\nH\nH\nH\nN\nN\nH\nH\nFigure 4.41  Hydrogen bonding between two ammonia \nmolecules.

So water is extensively hydrogen \nbonded with other water molecules. It has an average of \ntwo hydrogen bonds per molecule.\nδ+\nH\nH\nO\nδ–\nδ+\nδ+\nH\nH\nH\nH\nO\nO\nδ–\nδ–\nFigure 4.42  Water can form, on average, two hydrogen bonds \nper molecule.\nAmmonia is less extensively hydrogen bonded than \nwater (see Figure 4.41). It can form, on average, only one \nhydrogen bond per molecule. Although each ammonia \nmolecule has three hydrogen atoms attached to the \nnitrogen atom, it has only one lone pair of electrons that \ncan be involved in hydrogen bond formation.\nQuestion\n12\t \u0007Draw diagrams to show hydrogen bonding between \nthe following molecules:\n\u0007a\t \u0007ethanol, C2H5OH, and water\n\u0007b\t \u0007ammonia and water\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007two hydrogen fluoride molecules.\n\nHow does hydrogen bonding affect \nboiling point?\nSome compounds may have higher boiling points than \nexpected. This can be due to hydrogen bonding. Figure \n4.43 shows a graph of the boiling points of the hydrogen \nhalides, HF, HCl, HBr and HI, plotted against the position \nof the halogen in the Periodic Table.\n+50\nBoiling point /°C\n0\n–50\n–100\nHF\nHCl\nHBr\nHI\nFigure 4.43  The boiling points of the hydrogen halides.\nThe rise in boiling point from HCl to HI is due to the \nincreasing number of electrons in the halogen atoms as we \ngo down the group. This leads to increased van der Waals’ \nforces as the molecules get bigger. If hydrogen fluoride \nonly had van der Waals’ forces between its molecules, \nwe would expect its boiling point to be about –90 °C. \nHowever, the boiling point of hydrogen fluoride is 20 °C, \nwhich is much higher. This is because of the stronger \nintermolecular forces of hydrogen bonding between the \nHF molecules.\nQuestion\n13\t \u0007The table lists the boiling points of some Group 15 \nhydrides.\nHydride\nBoiling point / °C\nammonia, NH3\n–33\nphosphine, PH3\n–88\narsine, AsH3\n–55\nstibine, SbH3\n–17\na\t \u0007Explain the trend in the boiling points from \nphosphine to stibine.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Explain why the boiling point of ammonia does not \nfollow this trend.\n\n---\n\nThe peculiar properties of water\n1  Enthalpy change of vaporisation and \nboiling point\nWater has a much higher enthalpy change of vaporisation \nand boiling point than expected.\nThis is due to its extensive hydrogen bonding. Figure \n4.44 shows the enthalpy changes of vaporisation of water \nand other Group 16 hydrides.\nThe rise in enthalpy change of vaporisation from H2S \nto H2Te is due to the increasing number of electrons in \nthe Group 16 atoms as we go down the group. This leads \nto increased van der Waals’ forces as the molecules get \nbigger. If water only had van der Waals’ forces between \nits molecules, we would expect its enthalpy change to be \nabout 17 kJ mol–1. But the enthalpy change of vaporisation \nof water is much higher. This is because water is \nextensively hydrogen bonded. The boiling point of water \nis also much higher than predicted by the trend in boiling \npoints for the other Group 16 hydrides. This also indicates \nthat much more energy is required to break the bonds \nbetween water molecules compared with other hydrides of \nGroup 16 elements.\n65\n50\nH2O\n40\nEnthalpy change of \nvaporisation / kJ mol–1\n30\nH2Te\nH2S\nH2Se\n20\n10\n20\n0\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nNumber of electrons\nFigure 4.44  Enthalpy changes of vaporisation for Group 16 \nhydrides plotted against number of electrons present.\n2  Surface tension and viscosity\nWater has a high surface tension and high viscosity.\nHydrogen bonding reduces the ability of water \nmolecules to slide over each other, so the viscosity of \nwater is high. The hydrogen bonds in water also exert a \nsignificant downward force at the surface of the liquid. \nThis causes the surface tension of water to be higher than \nfor most liquids.",

          "content": "Bonding and physical \nproperties\nThe type of bonding between atoms, ions or molecules \ninfluences the physical properties of a substance.\nPhysical state at room temperature and \npressure\nIonic compounds\nIonic compounds are solids at room temperature and \npressure. This is because:\n■\n■\nthere are strong electrostatic forces (ionic bonds) holding \nthe positive and negative ions together\n■\n■\nthe ions are regularly arranged in a lattice (see Chapter 5), \nwith the oppositely charged ions close to each other.\nIonic compounds have high melting points, high boiling \npoints and high enthalpy changes of vaporisation. It \ntakes a lot of energy to overcome the strong electrostatic \nattractive forces.\nMetals\nMetals, apart from mercury, are solids. Most metals have \nhigh melting points, high boiling points and high enthalpy \nchanges of vaporisation. This is because it takes a lot of \nenergy to overcome the strong attractive forces between \nthe positive ions and the ‘sea’ of delocalised electrons.\nCovalent compounds\nCovalently bonded substances with a simple molecular \nstructure, for example water and ammonia, are usually \nliquids or gases. This is because the forces between the \nmolecules are weak. It does not take much energy to \novercome these intermolecular forces, so these substances \nhave low melting points, low boiling points and low \nenthalpy changes of vaporisation compared with ionic \ncompounds. Some substances that have covalently bonded \nmolecules may be solids at room temperature, for example \niodine and poly(ethene). These are usually molecules \nwhere the van der Waals’ forces are considerable. However, \nthe melting points of these substances are still fairly low \ncompared with ionic compounds or most metals.\nSolubility\nIonic compounds\nMost ionic compounds are soluble in water. This is because \nwater molecules are polar and they are attracted to the \nions on the surface of the ionic solid. These attractions \nare called ion–dipole attractions (see page 265). These\n\nattractions replace the electrostatic forces between the ions \nand the ions go into solution.\nMetals\nMetals do not dissolve in water. However, some metals, for \nexample sodium and calcium, react with water.\nCovalent compounds\nCovalently bonded substances with a simple molecular \nstructure fall into two groups.\n■\n■\nThose that are insoluble in water. Most covalently bonded \nmolecules are non-polar. Water molecules are not attracted \nto them so they are insoluble. An example is iodine.\n■\n■\nThose that are soluble in water. Small molecules that can \nform hydrogen bonds with water are generally soluble. An \nexample is ethanol, C2H5OH.\nSome covalently bonded substances react with water rather \nthan dissolving in it. For example, hydrogen chloride \nreacts with water to form hydrogen ions and chloride ions, \nand the ions are soluble. Silicon chloride reacts with water \nto form hydrogen ions, chloride ions and silicon dioxide. \nThis reaction is called a hydrolysis reaction.\nElectrical conductivity\nIonic compounds\nIonic compounds do not conduct electricity when in the \nsolid state. This is because the ions are fixed in the lattice \nand can only vibrate around a fixed point. When molten, \nan ionic compound conducts electricity because the ions \nare mobile.\nSummary\n■\t Ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons.\n■\t Ionic (electrovalent) bonding involves an \nattractive force between positively and negatively \ncharged ions in an ionic lattice.\n■\t A covalent bond is formed when atoms share a pair \nof electrons.\n■\t When atoms form covalent or ionic bonds each atom \nor ion has a full outer electron shell of electrons. \n(Some covalent compounds may be electron \ndeficient or have an ‘expanded octet’.)\n■\t Dot-and-cross diagrams can be drawn to show \nthe arrangement of electrons in ionic and \ncovalent compounds.\n\n---\n\nMetals\nMetals conduct electricity both when solid and when \nmolten. This is because the delocalised electrons are \nmobile.\nCovalent compounds\nCovalently bonded substances with a simple molecular \nstructure do not conduct electricity.

In reality, the gases we encounter don’t fit this \ndescription exactly, although they may come very close. \nThe gases we encounter are called real gases.\nNoble gases with small atoms, such as helium and \nneon, approach ideal gas behaviour.

This is because the gas \nmolecules are constantly hitting the walls of the container. \nIf we decrease the volume of a gas (at constant temperature) \nthe molecules are squashed closer together and hit the \nwalls of the container more often. So the pressure of the gas \nincreases (Figure 5.2a). A graph of volume of gas plotted \nagainst 1/pressure gives a proportional relationship (as \nshown by the straight line in Figure 5.2b). We say that the \nvolume is inversely proportional to the pressure.\nWhen a gas is heated at constant pressure its volume \nincreases (Figure 5.3a). This is because the particles move \nfaster and hit the walls of the container with greater force. If \nthe pressure is to be constant the molecules must get further \napart.

Use the kinetic theory of \ngases to explain why the tubes should not be heated \nto high temperatures.\nLimitations of the ideal gas laws\nScientists have taken accurate measurements to show how \nthe volumes of gases change with temperature and pressure. \nThese show us that gases do not always behave exactly as we \nexpect an ideal gas to behave. This is because real gases do \nnot always obey the kinetic theory in two ways:\n■\n■\nthere is not zero attraction between the molecules\n■\n■\nwe cannot ignore the volume of the molecules themselves.\nThese differences are especially noticeable at very \nhigh pressures and very low temperatures.

Compounds with \nionic lattices are sometimes called giant ionic structures.\nThe type of lattice formed depends on the relative sizes \nof the ions present. The ionic lattices for sodium chloride \nand magnesium oxide are cubic. In sodium chloride, \neach sodium ion is surrounded by six oppositely charged \nchloride ions. The chloride ions are much larger than the \nsodium ions. The sodium ions fit into the spaces between \nthe chloride ions so that they are as close as possible to \nthem (Figure 5.6).\na\nb\nNa\n+\nCl–\nCl–\nNa\n+\nCl–\nNa\n+\nCl–\nNa\n+\nCl–\nNa\n+\nNa\n+\nCl–\nNa\n+\nCl–\nCl–\nNa\n+\nNa\n+\nCl–\nFigure 5.6  The arrangement of the ions in sodium chloride: \na  the actual packing of the ions; b  an ‘exploded’ view so that \nyou can see the arrangement of the ions clearly.\nMagnesium oxide has the same lattice structure as sodium \nchloride. Magnesium ions replace sodium ions and the \noxide ions replace the chloride ions.\nThe properties of ionic compounds reflect their \nstructure as well as their bonding.\n■\n■\nThey are hard. It takes a lot of energy to scratch the \nsurface because of the strong attractive forces keeping the \nions together.\n■\n■\nThey are brittle. Ionic crystals may split apart when hit in \nthe same direction as the layers of ions. The layers of ions \nmay be displaced by the force of the blow so that ions with \nthe same charge come together. The repulsions between \nthousands of ions in the layers, all with the same charge, \ncause the crystal to split along these cleavage planes.\n■\n■\nThey have high melting points and high boiling points \nbecause the attraction between the large numbers of \noppositely charged ions in the lattice acts in all directions \nand bonds them strongly together. The melting points \nand boiling points increase with the charge density on the \nions. So magnesium oxide, Mg2+O2–, has a higher melting \npoint (2852 °C) than sodium chloride, Na+Cl– (801 °C). \nThis is because there is a greater electrostatic attraction \nbetween doubly charged ions than singly charged ions of \nsimilar size.\n■\n■\nMany of them are soluble in water (see page 265).\n\nFigure 5.7  Sapphires sparkle in the light when polished. They \nare cut by exerting a force on the cleavage planes between \nlayers of ions in the crystal.\nMetallic lattices\nIn Chapter 4, we learnt that a metallic lattice consists of \nions surrounded by a sea of electrons. The ions are often \npacked in hexagonal layers or in a cubic arrangement. \nWhen a force is applied, the layers can slide over each \nother. But in a metallic bond, the attractive forces between \nthe metal ions and the delocalised electrons act in all \ndirections. So when the layers slide, new metallic bonds \nare easily re-formed between ions in new lattice positions \nand the delocalised electrons (Figure 5.8). The delocalised \nelectrons continue to hold the ions in the lattice together. \nThe metal now has a different shape. This explains why \nmetals are malleable (they can be hammered into different \nshapes) and ductile (they can be drawn into wires). The \nhigh tensile strength and hardness of most metals is also \ndue to the strong attractive forces between the metal ions \nand the delocalised electrons.\n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n– \n– \n– \n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nforce\napplied\n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n– \n– \n– \n– – \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \n– \nFigure 5.8  When a force is applied to a metallic structure, \nthe layers slide over each other and re-form in new lattice \npositions.\n\n---\n\nFigure 5.9  You can clearly see the metal crystals or ‘grains’ in \nthis metal plate.\nAlloys and their properties\nAn alloy is a mixture of two or more metals or a metal \nwith a non-metal. The metal added to create the alloy \nbecomes part of the crystal lattice of the other metal.\nBrass is an alloy of copper (70%) with zinc (30%). \nIt is stronger than copper but still malleable. For these \nreasons it is used for musical instruments, ornaments and \nhousehold items such as door handles.\nBut why is brass stronger than pure copper?\nZinc ions are larger than copper ions. The presence \nof different-sized metal ions makes the arrangement of \nthe lattice less regular. This stops the layers of ions from \nsliding over each other so easily when a force is applied \n(Figure 5.10).\n79\nforce\npure metal\nlayers slide\nlayers cannot slide\nvery easily\nforce\nalloy\nFigure 5.10  The layers of ions in an alloy slide less easily \nthan in a pure metal because the structure of the lattice is \nless regular.",

We call these structures giant \nmolecular structures or giant covalent structures. \nThey have high melting and boiling points because of \nthe large number of strong covalent bonds linking the \nwhole structure. Both elements, such as carbon (graphite \nand diamond), and compounds, such as silicon dioxide, \ncan be giant molecular structures. Carbon and graphite \nare different forms of the same element. Different \ncrystalline or molecular forms of the same element are \ncalled allotropes.\nGraphite\nIn graphite, the carbon atoms are arranged in planar \nlayers. Within the layers, the carbon atoms are arranged \nin hexagons. Each carbon atom is joined to three other \ncarbon atoms by strong covalent bonds (Figure 5.12). The \nfourth electron of each carbon atom occupies a p orbital. \nThese p orbitals on every carbon atom in each planar \nlayer overlap sideways. A cloud of delocalised electrons \nis formed above and below the plane of the carbon rings. \nThese electron clouds join up to form extended delocalised \nrings of electrons.\n\nFigure 5.12  The structure of graphite.\nThe layers of carbon atoms are kept next to each other by \nweak van der Waals’ forces.\nThe properties of graphite are related to its structure.\n■\n■\nHigh melting and boiling points: there is strong covalent \nbonding throughout the layers of carbon atoms.

The carbon atoms \nare tetrahedrally arranged around each other. The network \nof carbon atoms extends almost unbroken throughout the \nwhole structure. The regular arrangement of the atoms \ngives diamond a crystalline structure.\nFigure 5.13  The structure of diamond.\nThe properties of diamond are related to its structure.\n\n---\n\n■\n■\nHardness: diamond cannot be scratched easily because it is \ndifficult to break the three-dimensional network of strong \ncovalent bonds.\n■\n■\nDoes not conduct electricity or heat: each of the four outer \nelectrons on every carbon atom is involved in covalent \nbonding.

The first \nnanotubes to be made were one layer of carbon atoms in \nthickness. More recently nanotubes have behave been made \nwith thicker walls with several tubes inside one another. \nAlthough the diameter of a nanotube is very small, it \ncan be made relatively long. The length of the nanotube \ncylinder can be a million times greater than its diameter.\nFigure 5.17  Part of the structure of a nanotube. The ends of \nthe cylinder are often closed.\nNanotubes have characteristic properties:\n■\n■\nThey have high electrical conductivity along the long axis \nof the cylinder. This is because, like graphite, some of the \nelectrons are delocalised and are able to move along the \ncylinder when a voltage is applied.\n■\n■\nThey have a very high tensile strength when a force is \napplied along the long axis of the cylinder. They can be up to \n100 times stronger than steel of the same thickness.\n■\n■\nThey have very high melting points (typically about 3500 °C). \nThis is because there is strong covalent bonding throughout \nthe structure.\n\n---\n\nGraphene\nGraphene is a single isolated layer of graphite (Figure 5.18). \nThe hexagonally arranged sheet of carbon atoms is not \ncompletely rigid and it can be distorted.\na\nb\nFigure 5.18  a  Part of a graphene sheet. b  ‘Waves’ in a sheet \nof graphene.\nGraphene has some of the properties of graphite, but they \nare more exaggerated. For example:\n■\n■\nGraphene is the most chemically reactive form of carbon. \nSingle sheets of graphene burn at very low temperatures \nand are much more reactive than graphite.\n■\n■\nGraphene is extremely strong for its mass.\n83\n■\n■\nFor a given amount of material, graphene conducts \nelectricity and heat much better than graphite.\nIt has been said that ‘a one square metre hammock made \nof graphene could support a 4 kg cat but would weigh \nonly as much as the cat’s whisker’. Potential applications \nof graphene include use in tiny electrical circuits and for \ntiny transistors, touchscreens, solar cells and other energy \nstorage devices.\nQuestion\n13\t \u0007Suggest, using ideas of structure and bonding, why:\n\u0007a\t \u0007buckminsterfullerene, C60, is converted from a \nsolid to a gas at a relatively low temperature\n\u0007b\t \u0007graphene is a good conductor of electricity\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007nanotubes conduct electricity better along the \nlong axis of the tube than across the tube\n\u0007d\t \u0007buckminsterfullerene, C60, is relatively soft.\n\nEarth’s crust are often thrown away. This leads to huge \nwaste dumps and landfill sites scarring the landscape \nand problems with litter. Extracting metals from their \nores requires a lot of energy. Energy resources are also \nlimited and we need to conserve these as well. One way \nto help conserve materials and energy is to recycle metals \n(Figure 5.19).\n84\nFigure 5.19  Remember to recycle your cans. As well as \naluminium cans, we can also save energy and resources by \nrecycling steel cans.\nRecycling materials\nLarge amounts of energy are needed to extract and purify \nmetals. It is often cheaper to collect used metals and \nrecycle them rather than extract them from their ores.\nRecycling has several advantages:\n■\n■\nit saves energy (this helps tackle global warming, as we burn \nless fossil fuel)\n■\n■\nit conserves supplies of the ore\n\n---\n\n■\n■\nlandfill sites do not get filled up as fast and there is \nless waste\n■\n■\nit is cheaper than extracting the metal from the ore.\nIt is not always easy to recycle metals. They have to be \ncollected and sorted and then transported to the recycling \nplant. This takes energy and money. It may be difficult \nto separate individual metals. For example ‘tin’ cans are \nmade from steel coated with tin. The two metals have to be \nseparated before they can be used again. Two metals that \ncan be recycled easily are copper and aluminium.\nCopper\nMost copper ores remaining in the Earth contain less than \n1% copper. Recycling copper is important because:\n■\n■\nless energy is needed to recycle copper than is needed \nto transport copper ore to the smelting plant and extract \ncopper from it\n■\n■\nless energy is needed to extract and refine the recycled \ncopper so that it is pure enough to be electrolysed.\nThe copper used for water pipes and cooking utensils \ndoes not have to be very pure, so little purification of \nrecycled copper is needed for these uses. The copper used \nfor electrical wiring has to be 99.99% pure. This has to be \npurified by electrolysis.\nAluminium\nPurifying and remoulding aluminium is much cheaper \nthan extracting aluminium from bauxite ore. Savings are \nmade because:\n■\n■\nit is not necessary to extract the aluminium ore from \nthe ground or to transport it to the smelting plant; these \nprocesses require energy\n■\n■\nthe treatment of bauxite to make pure aluminium oxide for \nelectrolysis does not need to be carried out\n■\n■\nthe aluminium scrap needs less energy to melt it, compared \nwith melting aluminium oxide\n■\n■\nthe expensive electrolysis of aluminium oxide does not need \nto be carried out .\nThere is a 95% saving in energy if we recycle aluminium \nrather than extract it from its ore.\n\nSummary\n■ The kinetic theory of gases states that gas particles \nare always in constant random motion at a variety \nof speeds.\n■ The volume of a gas increases when the \ntemperature increases and decreases when the \npressure increases.\n■ The volume of a gas under different conditions of \ntemperature and pressure can be calculated using \nthe ideal gas equation pV = nRT.\n■ The ideal gas equation can be used to determine the \nrelative molecular mass of simple molecules.\n■ Gases do not obey the ideal gas equation at low \ntemperatures and high pressures.\n■ The kinetic-molecular model can be used to describe \nthe states of matter in terms of proximity and motion \nof the particles, and to describe changes of state and \nvapour pressure.\n■ Ionic compounds such as sodium chloride and \nmagnesium oxide form a giant three-dimensional \nlattice structure containing ions in a regularly \nrepeating pattern.\n■ The strong ionic forces acting in all directions \nbetween the ions in the lattice cause ionic \nsubstances to have high melting and boiling points.\nEnd-of-chapter questions\n1 Four types of structure are:\ngiant molecular\ngiant ionic\ngiant metallic\nsimple molecular\na Give two examples of a giant ionic structure and two examples of a simple molecular structure. \n[4]\nb Explain why substances with giant ionic structures are often brittle but metallic structures are malleable.

Enthalpy is the total energy associated with \nthe materials that react. The symbol for enthalpy is H. \nWe cannot measure enthalpy, but we can measure an \nenthalpy change when heat energy is exchanged with the \nsurroundings.

This \nsymbol is often used to mean a change in a quantity. \nFor example, ΔT means a change in temperature and ΔH \nmeans the enthalpy change.\nThe units of enthalpy change are kilojoules per mole \n(kJ mol–1).\nWe can draw enthalpy profile diagrams (also known \nas reaction pathway diagrams) to show enthalpy changes. \nThe enthalpy of the reactants and products is shown \non the y-axis. The x-axis shows the reaction pathway, \nwith reactants on the left and products on the right. \nFor an exothermic reaction, energy is released to the \nsurroundings.

          "content": "Measuring enthalpy changes\nWe can measure the enthalpy change of some reactions by \ndifferent techniques. These are outlined in the ‘Measuring \nenthalpy changes’ box.\nMeasuring enthalpy changes\nCalorimetry\nWe can measure the enthalpy change of some \nreactions by a technique called calorimetry. The \napparatus used is called a calorimeter. A simple \ncalorimeter can be a polystyrene drinking cup \n(Figure 6.5), a vacuum flask or a metal can.\nthermometer (reading to 0.2 °C)\nplastic lid\npolystyrene cup\nreaction\nmixture\n94\nFigure 6.5  A polystyrene cup can act as a calorimeter for \nfinding some enthalpy changes.\nWhen carrying out experiments in calorimeters we \nuse known amounts of reactants and known volumes \nof liquids. We also measure the temperature change \nof the liquid in the calorimeter as the reaction occurs. \nThe thermometer should be accurate to 0.1 or 0.2 °C.\nCalorimetry relies on the fact that it takes 4.18 J of \nenergy to increase the temperature of 1 g of water by \n1 °C. The energy required to raise the temperature \nof 1 g of a liquid by 1 °C is called the specific heat \ncapacity, c, of the liquid. So, the specific heat \ncapacity of water is 4.18 J g–1 °C–1.\nThe energy transferred as heat (the enthalpy change) \nis given by the relationship:\nΔH = –mcΔT\nwhere:\nΔH is the enthalpy change, in J\nm is the mass of water, in g\nc is the specific heat capacity, in J g–1 °C–1\nΔT is the temperature change, in °C\n\n---\n\nAs 1 cm3 of water weighs 1 g, we can substitute volume \nof water in cm3 of water for mass of water in g in the \nequation. Aqueous solutions of acids, alkalis and salts \nare assumed to be largely water.\nWith solutions we make the assumptions that:\n■\n■\n1 cm3 of solution has a mass of 1 g\n■\n■\nthe solution has the same specific heat capacity as water.\nNote: A rise in temperature is given a positive sign. So \nthe value of ΔH is negative for an exothermic reaction. \nA fall in temperature is given a negative sign. So the \nvalue of ΔH is positive for an endothermic reaction.\nThe enthalpy change of neutralisation by \nexperiment\nWe can find the enthalpy change of neutralisation \nof sodium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid by mixing \nequal volumes of known equimolar concentrations of \nacid and alkali together in a polystyrene cup. A typical \nprocedure for the reaction above is as follows.\n1\t Place 50 cm3 of 1.0 mol dm–3 hydrochloric acid in the cup \nand record its temperature.\n2\t Add 50 cm3 of 1.0 mol dm–3 sodium hydroxide (at the \nsame temperature) to the acid in the cup.\n3\t Stir the reaction mixture with the thermometer and \nrecord the highest temperature.\nIn this experiment most of the heat is transferred to \nthe solution, as the polystyrene cup is a good insulator. \nCooling of the warm solution is not a great problem: \nthe reaction is rapid so the maximum temperature is \nreached before much cooling of the warm solution has \noccurred. However, there are still heat losses to the air \nand to the thermometer, which make the result less \nexothermic than the data book value of –57.1 kJ mol–1.\nResults and calculation\nmass of solution\t\n=\t \u0007100 g (50 cm3 of acid \nplus 50 cm3 of alkali and \nassuming that 1.0 cm3 of \nsolution has a mass of 1.0 g)\n\nMeasuring enthalpy changes (continued)\nspecific heat capacity\t\n=\t \u00074.18 J g–1 °C–1 (assuming \nthat the heat capacity of \nthe solution is the same as \nthe heat capacity of water)\nstarting temperature of \t =\t 21.3 °C\nreactant solutions\nfinal temperature of\t \t\n=\t 27.8 °C\nproduct solution\ntemperature rise\t\n=\t +6.5 °C\nuse the relationship\t ΔH\t=\t –mcΔT\nheat energy released\t\t\n=\t –100 × 4.18 × 6.5 = –2717 J\nAt the start, the reaction mixture contained 50 cm3 \nof 1.0 mol dm–3 hydrochloric acid and 50 cm3 of \n1.0 mol dm–3 sodium hydroxide.

We use known amounts of solute and \nsolvent with the solvent in excess to make sure that \nall the solute dissolves.\nThe procedure is:\n1\t Weigh an empty polystyrene cup.\n2\t Pour 100 cm3 of water into the cup and weigh the cup \nand water.\n3\t Record the steady temperature of the water with a \nthermometer reading to at least the nearest 0.2 °C.\n4\t Add a few pellets of sodium hydroxide (corrosive!) \nwhich have been stored under dry conditions.\n5\t Keep the mixture stirred continuously with a \nthermometer and record the temperature at fixed \nintervals, e.g. every 20 seconds.\n6\t Keep recording the temperature for 5 minutes after the \nmaximum temperature has been reached.\n\n---\n\n7\t Weigh the cup and its contents to calculate the mass of \nsodium hydroxide which dissolved.\nResults and calculations\nmass of polystyrene cup\t\n=\t 23.00 g\nmass of polystyrene cup + water\t\n=\t 123.45 g\nmass of water\t\n=\t 100.45 g\nmass of cup + water + sodium hydroxide\t\n=\t 124.95 g\nmass of sodium hydroxide that dissolved\t =\t 1.50 g\ninitial temperature of water\t\n=\t 18.0 °C\nfinal temperature of water\t\n=\t 21.6 °C\ntemperature rise\t\n=\t +3.6 °C\nFrom the results, 1.50 g of sodium hydroxide dissolved \nin 100.45 cm3 (100.45 g) of water and produced a \ntemperature change of +3.6 °C.\n(\n)\nenthalpy\t =\t – mass of\t ×\t specific heat\t ×\t temperature\nchange \t\n\t water\t\n\t\t capacity (in\t\n\t change\n(in J)\t\n\t (in g)\t\n\t\t J g–1 °C–1)\t\n\t\t (in °C)\n=\t –(100.45\t\n×\t 4.18\t\n\t×\t3.6)\n=\t \u0007–1511.57 J = –1.5 kJ (to 2 significant figures)\n95\nThe enthalpy change for 1.5 g sodium hydroxide is –1.5 kJ\nThe enthalpy change for 1.0 mole of sodium hydroxide \n(Mr = 40 g mol–1)\nis –​ 40 \n___ \n1.5 ​ × 1.5 kJ = –40 kJ\nΔH\nO\n—\nsol = –40 kJ mol–1\nIn this experiment we are assuming that the specific \nheat capacity of the solution is the same as the \nspecific heat capacity of water. The heat losses in this \nexperiment, however, are likely to be considerable \nbecause the sodium hydroxide takes some time to \ndissolve. This means that the reaction mixture has a \nlonger period of cooling.\nFinding the enthalpy change of combustion\nExperiment: the enthalpy change of combustion of \npropan-1-ol\nWe can find the enthalpy change of combustion by \nburning a known mass of substance and using the heat \nreleased to raise the temperature of a known mass of \nwater.

The \nO   H bond in water has a slightly different bond energy \nvalue to the O   H bond in ethanol; in ethanol the oxygen is \nconnected to a carbon atom rather than another hydrogen \natom. The O   H bond is in a different environment. \nIdentical bonds in molecules with two (or more) types of \nbond have different bond energies when we measure them. \nIt takes more energy to break the first O   H bond in water \nthan to break the second. For these reasons we use average \nbond energies taken from a number of bonds of the same \ntype but in different environments.\nWe cannot usually find the value of bond energies \ndirectly so we have to use an enthalpy cycle. The average \nbond energy of the C   H bond in methane can be found \nusing the enthalpy changes of atomisation of carbon and \nhydrogen and the enthalpy change of combustion or \nformation of methane.\nThe enthalpy cycle for calculating the average C   H \nbond energy is shown in Figure 6.15. Using the enthalpy \ncycle shown in Figure 6.15, the average C   H bond energy \ncan be found by dividing the value of ΔH on the diagram \nby four (because there are four C   H bonds in a molecule \nof methane).\nCH4(g)\n∆H\nC(g) + 4H(g)\n∆Hf [CH4(g)] \n∆Hat [(graphite)]\n+ 4∆Hat [ H2(g)]\n1\n2\nC(graphite) + 2H2(g)\nFigure 6.15  An enthalpy cycle to find the average bond \nenergy of the C   H bond.

We do this by using oxidation numbers \n(oxidation numbers are also called oxidation states). An \noxidation number is a number given to each atom or ion in a \ncompound that shows us its degree of oxidation. Oxidation \nnumbers can be positive, negative or zero. The + or – sign must \nalways be included. Higher positive oxidation numbers mean \nthat an atom or ion is more oxidised. Higher negative oxidation \nnumbers mean that an atom or ion is more reduced.\nOxidation number rules\nWe can deduce the oxidation number of any atom or \nion by using oxidation number rules. It is important to \nnote that an oxidation number refers to a single atom in \na compound.\n1\t The oxidation number of any uncombined element is \nzero. For example, the oxidation number of each atom \nin S8, Cl2 and Zn is zero.\n2\t In compounds many atoms or ions have fixed \noxidation numbers\n–\t Group 1 elements are always +1\n–\t Group 2 elements are always +2\n–\t fluorine is always –1\n–\t hydrogen is +1 (except in metal hydrides such as \nNaH, where it is –1)\n–\t oxygen is –2 (except in peroxides, where it is –1, and \nin F2O, where it is +2).\n\n---\n\n4\t The sum of the oxidation numbers in a compound \nis zero.\n5\t The sum of the oxidation numbers in an ion is equal to \nthe charge on the ion.\n6\t In either a compound or an ion, the more \nelectronegative element is given the negative \noxidation number.\nFigure 7.2  This is part of a ship’s hull. It is made of iron \nprotected by bars of magnesium metal.

In this \ncase heating and adding water are not being carried out \nat the same time. However, there is a type of chemical \nreaction in which the forward reaction and the backward \nreaction take place at the same time.\nIn many chemical reactions the reactants are not \nused up completely. Some products are formed but the \nmaximum theoretical yield is not obtained. A mixture \nof products and reactants is formed. The products react \ntogether to re-form reactants at the same time as the \nreactants are forming products. This type of reversible \nreaction is called an equilibrium reaction. We show that \nequilibrium reactions are reversible by the sign \n.\nFor example, consider the reaction between hydrogen \nand iodine carried out in a sealed glass tube at 400 °C:\n117\nH2(g)  +  I2(g) \n 2HI(g)\nMolecules of hydrogen iodide are breaking down to \nhydrogen and iodine at the same rate as hydrogen \nand iodine molecules are reacting together to form \nhydrogen iodide.\nhydrogen atom\niodine atom\n\nWhen fizzy drinks are made, carbon dioxide gas is \ndissolved in the drink under pressure.

This is because of the equilibrium\nCO2(g) \n CO2(aq)\nThe forward reaction happens during manufacture and the \nbackward reaction happens on opening.\nCharacteristics of equilibrium\nAn equilibrium reaction has four particular features under \nconstant conditions:\n■\n■\nit is dynamic\n■\n■\nthe forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate\n■\n■\nthe concentrations of reactants and products remain \nconstant at equilibrium\n■\n■\nit requires a closed system.\n1  It is dynamic\nThe phrase dynamic equilibrium means that the \nmolecules or ions of reactants and products are \ncontinuously reacting. Reactants are continuously being \nchanged to products and products are continuously being \nchanged back to reactants.\n118\n2  The forward and backward reactions occur \nat the same rate\nAt equilibrium the rate of the forward reaction equals \nthe rate of the backward reaction. Molecules or ions \nof reactants are becoming products, and those in the \nproducts are becoming reactants, at the same rate.\n3  The concentrations of reactants and \nproducts remain constant at equilibrium\nThe concentrations remain constant because, at \nequilibrium, the rates of the forward and backward \nreactions are equal. The equilibrium can be approached \nfrom two directions. For example, in the reaction\nH2(g)  +  I2(g) \n 2HI(g)\nWe can start by either:\n■\n■\nusing a mixture of colourless hydrogen gas and purple \niodine vapour, or\n■\n■\nusing only colourless hydrogen iodide gas.\n\n---\n\nFigure 8.4 shows what happens when 5.00 mol of \nhydrogen molecules and 5.00 mol of iodine molecules \nreact at 500 K in a vessel of volume 1 dm3.

When any of the reactants or \nproducts are gases, changes in pressure may also affect the \nposition of equilibrium. French chemist Henri Le Chatelier \n(1850–1936) observed how these factors affect the position \nof equilibrium. He put forward a general rule, known as \nLe Chatelier’s principle:\nIf one or more factors that affect an equilibrium is \nchanged, the position of equilibrium shifts in the direction \nthat reduces (opposes) the change.\n\nWe can predict the effect of changing concentration \nand pressure by referring to the stoichiometric equation \nfor the reaction. We can predict the effect of changing \nthe temperature by referring to the enthalpy change of \nthe reaction.\nHow does change in concentration affect \nthe position of equilibrium?\nWhen the concentration of one or more of the reactants \nis increased:\n■\n■\nthe system is no longer in equilibrium\n■\n■\nthe position of equilibrium moves to the right to reduce the \neffect of the increase in concentration of reactant\n■\n■\nmore products are formed until equilibrium is restored.\nWhen the concentration of one or more of the products \nis increased:\n■\n■\nthe system is no longer in equilibrium\n■\n■\nthe position of equilibrium moves to the left to reduce the \neffect of the increase in concentration of product\n■\n■\nmore reactants are formed until equilibrium is restored.\nFor example, look at the reaction:\n\tCH3COOH(l)\t+\tC2H5OH(l)\t\n\tCH3COOC2H5(l)\t+\tH2O(l)\n120\nethanoic acid\t\nethanol\t\nethyl ethanoate\t\nwater\nWhat happens when we add more ethanol?\n■\n■\nThe concentration of ethanol is increased.\n■\n■\nAccording to Le Chatelier’s principle, some of the ethanol \nmust be removed to reduce the concentration of the \nadded ethanol.\n■\n■\nThe position of equilibrium shifts to the right.\n■\n■\nMore ethanol reacts with ethanoic acid and more ethyl \nethanoate and water are formed.\nWhat happens when we add more water?\n■\n■\nThe concentration of water is increased.\n■\n■\nAccording to Le Chatelier’s principle, some of the water \nmust be removed to reduce the concentration of the \nadded water.\n■\n■\nThe position of equilibrium shifts to the left.\n■\n■\nSo more water reacts with ethyl ethanoate and more \nethanoic acid and ethanol are formed.\nWhat happens when we remove some water?\n■\n■\nThe concentration of water is decreased.\n■\n■\nAccording to Le Chatelier’s principle, some water must be \nadded to increase its concentration.\n■\n■\nThe position of equilibrium shifts to the right.\n■\n■\nSo more ethanoic acid reacts with ethanol and more water \nand ethyl ethanoate are formed.\n\n---\n\nQuestion\n3\t a\t Use this reaction:\nCH3COOH(l)  +  C2H5OH(l) \n CH3COOC2H5(l)  +  H2O(l)\n\u0007Explain what happens to the position of \nequilibrium when:\ni\t\nmore CH3COOC2H5(l) is added\nii\t some C2H5OH(l) is removed.\nb\t Use this reaction:\nCe4+(aq)  +  Fe2+(aq) \n Ce3+(aq)  +  Fe3+(aq)\n\u0007Explain what happens to the position of \nequilibrium when:\ni\t\nthe concentration of Fe2+(aq) ions is increased\nii\t water is added to the equilibrium mixture.\nFigure 8.7  Stalactites and stalagmites are formed as a result \nof water passing through rocks containing calcium carbonate. \nThe solution running through these rocks contains water, \ndissolved carbon dioxide and calcium hydrogencarbonate:\nCaCO3(s)  +  H2O(l)  +  CO2(aq) \n Ca(HCO3)2(aq)\nWhen droplets of this mixture are formed on the roof of the \ncave, some of the carbon dioxide in the droplets escapes \ninto the air.

Each molecule in a mixture of gases \ncontributes towards the total pressure. So, at constant \ntemperature, the more gas molecules there are in a given \nvolume, the higher the pressure.\nFigure 8.9 shows what happens when we increase the \npressure on the reaction represented by:\n\tX(g)\t\n+\t\nY(g)\t\nZ(g)\n\t1 mol\t\n1 mol\t\n1 mol\nIn this reaction there are two moles of gas on the left \nand one on the right.

          "content": "Equilibria and the chemical \nindustry\nAn understanding of equilibrium is important in the \nchemical industry. Equilibrium reactions are involved \nin some of the stages in the large-scale production of \nammonia, sulfuric acid and many other chemicals.\nEquilibrium and ammonia production\nThe synthesis of ammonia is carried out by the Haber \nprocess.

This is because the value of Kp \nis very high. The position of equilibrium is far over to the \nright even at atmospheric pressure. Very high pressure is \nunnecessary, and is not used as it is expensive.",

Many metal oxides or hydroxides are bases. \nSome bases dissolve in water to form hydroxide ions \nin solution. A base that is soluble in water is called an \nalkali. For example:\nNaOH(g)  +  aq \n Na+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nSome alkalis are formed by the reaction of a base with \nwater.

In 1923 the Danish \nchemist J. Brønsted and the English chemist T. Lowry \nsuggested a more general definition of acids and bases. \nThis definition is based on the idea that in an acid–base \nreaction, a proton is transferred from an acid to a base (a \nproton is a hydrogen ion, H+).\nH2O(l)\nHCl(g)\nproton\nH\nH\nH\nH\nthe proton, H+, is donated\nby the hydrogen chloride\nand accepted by the water…\n\n---\n\nA Brønsted–Lowry acid is a proton donor.\nA Brønsted–Lowry base is a proton acceptor.\nWhen hydrochloric acid is formed, hydrogen chloride gas \ndissolves in water and reacts to form hydroxonium ions, \nH3O+, and chloride ions (Figure 8.12). You can see that the \nwater is involved in the reaction.\nHCl(g)  +  H2O(l) \n H3O+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\nHydrochloric acid is an acid because it donates a proton \nto water. This means that water is acting as a Brønsted–\nLowry base. The water is accepting a proton.\nH+ donated\nHCl(g)  +  H2O(l) \n H3O+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\n\t acid\t\nbase\nWater can also act as an acid.

For example, when chloric(VII) acid \n(HClO4) reacts with ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) in an inert \nsolvent, the following equilibrium is set up:\nH+ donated\nHClO4  +  CH3COOH \n ClO4\n–  +  CH3COOH2\n+\nacid \t\nbase \n132\nIn this reaction HClO4 is the acid because it is donating a \nproton to CH3COOH. CH3COOH is the base because it is \na proton acceptor.\nWhen an acid or base reacts with water, an equilibrium \nmixture is formed. For acids such as hydrochloric acid, \nthe position of equilibrium is almost entirely in favour of \nthe products. But for ammonia the position of equilibrium \nfavours the reactants. The equations can be written to \nshow this. For example:\nHCl(g)  +  aq \n H+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\nA forward arrow is used as this reaction goes to \ncompletion.\nNH3(g)  +  H2O(l) \n NH4\n+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nAn equilibrium arrow is used as this reaction does not go \nto completion.\nQuestion\n14\t Identify which reactants are acids and which are bases \nin the following reactions:\na\t NH4\n+  +  H2O \n NH3  +  H3O+\nb\t HCOOH  +  HClO2 \n HCOOH2\n+  +  ClO2\n–\n\n---\n\nNH3(g)\n+\n+\nNH4+(aq)\nOH–(aq)\n+\nH\n–\nH\nH\nN\nO\nH\nH\n…forming\nthe positive\nammonium ion…\n…and the\nnegative\nhydroxide ion\nConjugate acids and conjugate bases\nIn a reaction at equilibrium, products are being converted \nto reactants at the same rate as reactants are being \nconverted to products. The reverse reaction can also be \nconsidered in terms of the Brønsted–Lowry theory of \nacids and bases.\nConsider the reaction:\nNH3(g)  +  H2O(l) \n NH4\n+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nIn the reverse reaction, the NH4\n+ ion donates a proton \nto the OH– ion.

          "content": "Reaction kinetics\nReaction kinetics is the study of the rates of chemical \nreactions. The data gathered from rate experiments can \ngive us an insight into how reactions take place. We can \nthen make deductions about the mechanism of a reaction.\nThe rate of a reaction can be defined as follows:\nrate = ​  change in amount of reactants or products \n___________________________________ \ntime \n​\nThe balanced chemical equation gives us no information \nabout the rate of a reaction. Experiments are needed \nto measure the rate at which reactants are used up or \nproducts are formed. For example, if a reaction gives off \na gas, we can measure the volume of gas released in the \ncourse of the reaction at regular time intervals (Figure 9.2).\ngas syringe\nFigure 9.2  Measuring the volume of gas given off over time \nenables us to calculate the rate of reaction in cm3 of gas per \nsecond.\n\n---\n\nin industrial processes and make useful products \nefficiently and safely.\nCollision theory\nWhen we explain the effects of concentration, \ntemperature, surface area and catalysts on rates of \nreaction, we use the collision theory. Collision theory \nstates that in order to react with each other, particles \nmust collide in the correct orientation and with sufficient \nenergy. The particles might be atoms, ions or molecules.\nWhen reactant particles collide they may simply \nbounce off each other, without changing. This is called an \nunsuccessful collision. An unsuccessful collision will take \nplace if the colliding particles do not have enough energy \nto react. If the reactant particles do have enough energy to \nreact, they may change into product particles when they \ncollide. This is called a successful (or effective) collision \n(Figure 9.3).\nThe minimum energy that colliding particles must \npossess for a successful collision to take place is called the \nactivation energy of that particular reaction.\nThe activation energy for an exothermic reaction and \nan endothermic reaction can be shown on enthalpy profile \ndiagrams, as shown in Figures 9.4 and 9.5.\n141\n\nFigure 9.3  a Unsuccessful and b successful (or effective) collisions.\nEnthalpy, H/kJmol–1\nactivation energy: start-up energy\n ‘pump-priming’\n the reaction\nreactants\n142\nproducts\n0\n0\nReaction pathway\nFigure 9.4  The activation energy in an exothermic reaction.\nFigure 9.5  The activation energy in an endothermic reaction.\nAccording to the collision theory, a reaction will speed \nup if:\n■\n■\nthe frequency of collisions increases\n■\n■\nthe proportion of particles with energy greater than the \nactivation energy increases.\nA catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a \nreaction but remains chemically unchanged itself at \nthe end of the reaction.

The \nmore concentrated a solution, the greater the number of \nparticles of solute dissolved in a given volume of solvent. \nIn reactions involving solutions, more concentrated \nreactants have a faster rate of reaction. This is because \nthe random motion of the particles in solution results in \nmore frequent collisions between reacting particles. This is \nshown in Figure 9.7.\nThe effect of pressure in reactions involving gases is \nsimilar to the effect of concentration in solutions. As we \nincrease the pressure of reacting gases, there are more \ngas molecules in a given volume. This results in more \ncollisions in any given time, and a faster rate of reaction.\na\nb\nFigure 9.7  The particles in box a are closer together than \nthose in box b.

A few particles will have a relatively small \namount of energy. A few particles will have a relatively \nlarge amount of energy. Most particles will have an \namount of energy somewhere in between. The distribution \nof energies at a given temperature can be shown on a graph \n(see Figure 9.8). This is called the Boltzmann distribution.\nIn Figure 9.8, the activation energy, Ea, is labelled. \nWe have seen that the activation energy is defined as the \nminimum energy required for colliding particles to react. \nWhen we raise the temperature of a reaction mixture, \nthe average kinetic (movement) energy of the particles \nincreases. Particles in solution and in gases will move \naround more quickly at a higher temperature, resulting in \nmore frequent collisions.

          "content": "Structure of the Periodic Table\nWe now know that the chemical elements are arranged in \nthe Periodic Table in order of atomic number, not atomic \nmasses as first thought. This explains why Mendeleev \nhad to re-order some elements in his table (which was \ndeveloped before scientists knew about the structure of the \natom). The modern Periodic Table is shown in Figure 10.2 \non page 150. There are 18 groups (vertical columns) in \nthe Periodic Table. The rows across the table are called \nperiods. In this chapter we will be looking for patterns \ngoing across the third period, from sodium (Na) to argon \n(Ar). The patterns seen across Period 3 are seen across \nother periods, too.

The units are nanometres, \nwhere 1 nm = 10−9 m.\nThe atoms of the noble gases in Group 18, such as argon \nin Period 3, do not have a covalent radius, as they do not \nform bonds with each other. Their atomic radii can be \ndetermined from their van der Waals’ radius. This is found \nfrom the distance between the nuclei of two neighbouring, \ntouching atoms, which are not chemically bonded \ntogether. This distance is divided by two to give the van \nder Waals’ radius. This figure will be higher than the single \ncovalent radius of any given element, as there is no overlap \nof electron clouds involved in the van der Waals’ radius \n(see Figure 10.3).\nAs shown in Figure 10.4, the atomic radius decreases across \nPeriod 3. The same pattern is also found in other periods. \nAcross a period, the number of protons (and hence the nuclear \n\n---\n\n0.15\nAtomic radius/ nm\n0.10\n0\n12\n11\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\nMg\nNa\nAl\nSi\nP\nS\nCl\nAr\nAtomic number\n\ncharge), and the number of electrons, increases by one with \neach successive element. The extra electron added to the \natoms of each successive element occupies the same principal \nquantum shell (energy level). This means that the shielding \neffect remains roughly constant (see page 35). So the greater \nattractive force exerted by the increasing positive nuclear \ncharge on the outer (valence) shell electrons pulls them in \ncloser to the nucleus. Hence the atomic radius decreases across \nthe period.\n2 Periodic patterns of ionic radii\nFrom your work in Chapter 4, you will know that the \natoms of metallic elements produce positively charged \nions (called cations), such as Na+. By contrast, the atoms of \nnon-metallic elements form negatively charged ions (called \nanions), such as Cl−. What pattern in ionic radii do we see \ngoing across Period 3? The data are shown in Table 10.2 \nand are displayed graphically in Figure 10.5.\nThe positively charged ions have effectively lost their \nouter shell of electrons (the third principal quantum shell \nor energy level) from their original atoms. Hence the \ncations are much smaller than their atoms. To add to this \neffect, there is also less shielding of the outer electrons in \nthese cations compared with their original atoms.\nGoing across the period, from Na+ to Si4+, the ions \nget smaller for reasons similar to those for the decreasing \n0.30\n0.20\nIonic radius / nm\n0.10\n0\n12\n11\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\nMg2+\nNa+\nAl3+\nSi4+\nP3–\nS2–\nCl–\nAr\nAtomic number\nFigure 10.5  Plotting the ionic radii against atomic number for \nthe elements in Period 3 (argon not included).\nTable 10.2  The ionic radii of Period 3 elements (no data are available for argon).\n\n---\n\natomic radii across a period. The increasing nuclear charge \nattracts the outermost (valence-shell) electrons in the \nsecond principal quantum shell (energy level) closer to the \nnucleus with increasing atomic number.\nThe negatively charged ions are larger than their original \natoms. This is because each atom will have gained one or \nmore extra electrons into their third principal quantum shell, \nincreasing the repulsion between its electrons, whereas the \nnuclear charge remains constant. This increases the size of any \nanion compared with its atom.\nThe anions decrease in size, going from P3− to Cl−, as \nthe nuclear charge increases across the period.\nQuestion\n2\t Look at the elements in Period 2 of the Periodic \nTable on page 473. Using your knowledge of Period 3 \nelements, predict and explain the relative sizes of:\na\t \u0007the atomic radii of lithium and fluorine\nb\t \u0007a lithium atom and its ion, Li+\nc\t\n\u0007an oxygen atom and its ion, O2−\nd\t \u0007a nitride ion, N3−, and a fluoride ion, F−.\n151\n3 Periodic patterns of melting points and \nelectrical conductivity\nPhysical properties, such as the melting point and \nelectrical conductivity of the elements, also show trends \nacross a period. Again, using Period 3 as an example, we \ncan show the data in tables and on graphs (see Tables 10.3 \nand 10.4 and the graph in Figure 10.6).\nThe electrical conductivity increases across the metals \nof Period 3 from sodium (Group 1) to aluminium \n(Group 13). The electrical conductivity then drops \ndramatically to silicon, which is described as a \nsemiconductor, and falls even further to the non-metallic \ninsulators phosphorus and sulfur.\nTo explain the trend in melting points and electrical \nconductivity across a period, we have to consider the \nbonding and structure of the elements (see Table 10.5).\nSodium, magnesium and aluminium, at the start of \nPeriod 3, are all metallic elements.

The delocalised electrons are those \nfrom the outermost (valence) shell. These delocalised \nelectrons are free to move around within the structure \nof the metal. When a potential difference is applied the \ndelocalised electrons drift through the metal towards the \npositive terminal. Both the melting point and the electrical \nconductivity increase from sodium to magnesium to \naluminium. This can be explained by the number of \nelectrons each metal donates into the ‘sea’ of delocalised \nelectrons and the increasing charge on the metal ions in \nthe giant metallic lattice. Each sodium atom donates just \none electron, forming Na+ ions in the lattice, whereas \n152\nPeriod 3 element\nsodium (Na) magnesium (Mg) aluminium (Al) silicon (Si) phosphorus (P) sulfur (S) chlorine (Cl) argon (Ar)\nMelting point / K\n371\n923\n932\n1683\n317\n392\n172\n84\nTable 10.3  The melting points of Period 3 elements (measured in kelvin, K, where 0 °C = 273 K).\nPeriod 3 element\nsodium (Na) magnesium (Mg) aluminium (Al) silicon (Si) phosphorus (P) sulfur (S) chlorine (Cl) argon (Ar)\nMelting point / K\n0.218\n0.224\n0.382\n2 × 10−10\n10−17\n10−23\n–\n–\nTable 10.4  The electrical conductivity of Period 3 elements (measured in siemens per metre, S m−1, where siemens are \nproportional to the ease with which electrons can pass through a material).\nPeriod 3 \nelement\nBonding\nmetallic\nmetallic\nmetallic\ncovalent\ncovalent\ncovalent\ncovalent\n–\nStructure\ngiant \nmetallic\ngiant \nmetallic\ngiant \nmetallic\ngiant \nmolecular\nsimple \nmolecular\nsimple \nmolecular\nsimple \nmolecular\nsimple \nmolecular\nTable 10.5  The bonding and structures of Period 3 elements.\n\n---\n\neach aluminium atom donates three electrons, forming \nAl3+ ions. This makes the metallic bonding in aluminium \nstronger, as the electrostatic forces of attraction between \nits 3+ ions and the larger number of negatively charged \ndelocalised electrons holding the giant structure together \nare stronger. There are also more delocalised electrons \navailable to drift through the structure when aluminium \nmetal conducts an electric current, making aluminium a \nbetter electrical conductor than sodium.\nThe element in the centre of Period 3, silicon, has \nthe highest melting point because of its giant molecular \nstructure (also called a giant covalent structure). Every \nsilicon atom is held to its neighbouring silicon atoms by \nstrong covalent bonds. However, its electrical conductivity \nis much lower than the metals at the start of the period \nbecause there are no delocalised electrons free to move \naround within its structure. Silicon is classed as a \nsemimetal, or metalloid.\nThe elements to the right of silicon are all non-metallic \nelements. They exist as relatively small molecules. Sulfur \nexists as S8 molecules, phosphorus as P4 molecules and \nchlorine as Cl2 molecules. Although the covalent bonds \nwithin each molecule are strong, there are only relatively \nweak van der Waals’ forces between their molecules (see \npage 62). Therefore, it does not take much energy to break \nthese weak intermolecular forces and melt the elements. At \nroom temperature, phosphorus and sulfur are solids with \nlow melting points and chlorine is a gas.\nArgon gas exists as single atoms with very weak van der \nWaals’ forces between these atoms.\nsodium \n(Na)\nmagnesium \n(Mg)\naluminium \n(Al)\nsilicon \n(Si)\nphosphorus \n(P)\nsulfur \n(S)\nchlorine \n(Cl)\nargon \n(Ar)\n\nQuestion\n3\t a\t \u0007Why does sulfur have a lower melting point \nthan silicon?\nb\t \u0007Why does sulfur have a higher melting point \nthan chlorine?\nc\t\n\u0007Why is magnesium a better electrical conductor \nthan:\ni\t\n\u0007phosphorus?\nii\t \u0007sodium?\n4 Periodic patterns of first ionisation \nenergies\nYou have looked at the pattern in first ionisation energies \nfor the first two periods on page 41.

As \nelectrons are in the same shell, the shielding effect is \nsimilar in atoms of each element. There are small ‘dips’ in \nthe general trend across the period between Mg and Al, \nand between P and S. The same pattern appears in Period \n2 for Be and B, and N and O.

          "content": "Chlorides of Period 3 elements\nOxidation numbers of the Period 3 \nelements in their chlorides\nTable 10.11 shows the formulae of the common chlorides \nof the Period 3 elements.\nThe oxidation numbers rise as we cross Period 3, until \nwe reach sulfur in Group 16. This happens because the \nPeriod 3 elements from sodium to phosphorus use all the \nelectrons in their outermost shell, their valence electrons, \nin bonding to chlorine (ox. no. = −1). They all exist in \npositive oxidation states because chlorine has a higher \nelectronegativity than any of the other Period 3 elements \n(see Table 10.11).\n\nEffect of water on chlorides of Period 3 elements\nAs with the oxides of Period 3 elements, the chlorides \nalso show characteristic behaviour when we add \nthem to water. Once again, this is linked to their \nstructure and bonding (Table 10.12).\nAt the start of Period 3, the ionic chlorides of sodium \n(NaCl) and magnesium (MgCl2) do not react with \nwater. The polar water molecules are attracted to the \nions, dissolving the chlorides by breaking down the \ngiant ionic structures. The solutions formed contain \nthe positive metal ions and the negative chloride ions \nsurrounded by water molecules. The metal ions and \nthe chloride ions are called hydrated ions:\n water\nNaCl(s) \n Na+(aq)  +  Cl−(aq)\nAluminium chloride is sometimes represented as \nAlCl3, which suggests that its chemical bonding is \nlikely to be ionic – with Al3+ ions and Cl− ions in a giant \nlattice. In solid hydrated aluminium chloride crystals, \nthis is the case. However, without water it exists \nas Al2Cl6. This can be thought of as a dimer of AlCl3 \n(two molecules joined together). This is a covalently \nbonded molecule (see Figure 10.13).\nFigure 10.13  The chemical bonding in Al2Cl6.\n\n---\n\nOnce we add water, the dimers are broken down and \naluminium ions and chloride ions enter the solution. \nEach relatively small and highly charged Al3+ ion is \nhydrated and causes a water molecule bonded to it \nto lose an H+ ion, thus turning the solution acidic. We \ncan show this in an equation as follows:\n[Al(H2O)6]3+(aq) \n [Al(H2O)5OH]2+(aq)  +  H+(aq)\nThe non-metal chlorides, SiCl4 and PCl5, are \nhydrolysed in water, releasing white fumes \nof hydrogen chloride gas in a rapid reaction \n(Figure 10.14).\nSiCl4(l)  +  2H2O(l) \n SiO2O(s)  +  4HCl(g)\nThe SiO2 is seen as an off-white precipitate.

As \nthey are in Group 2, the elements have atoms whose \nelectronic configurations end with two electrons in their \noutermost principal quantum shell.

          "content": "Reactions of Group 2 elements\nThe Group 2 metals form ionic compounds. When they \nreact, their atoms lose the two electrons from their \noutermost s subshell and form an ion with the stable \nelectronic configuration of a noble gas. This creates a 2+ \nion. For example, in the ionisation of a magnesium atom \nto a magnesium ion:\nMg \n Mg2+  +  2e−\noxidation number\t\n0\t\n+2\nThe metals act as reducing agents. Their atoms give away \nelectrons and so they are oxidised themselves as they react \nto form their 2+ ions. The ionisation energies shown in \nTable 11.3 show how easily the two outer electrons are \nremoved from the Group 2 atoms.\nGroup 2 \nelement\nFirst ionisation \nenergy / kJ mol−1\nSecond ionisation \nenergy / kJ mol−1\nberyllium (Be)\n900\n1760\nmagnesium (Mg)\n736\n1450\ncalcium (Ca)\n590\n1150\nstrontium (Sr)\n548\n1060\n165\nbarium (Ba)\n502\n 966\nTable 11.3  The first and second ionisation energies of the \nGroup 2 elements.\nThe metals in Group 2 get more reactive as we go down the \ngroup. As you can see from Table 11.3, it takes less energy \n(i.e. it gets easier) to remove the pair of outer electrons \ngoing down Group 2. So, although the positive charge \non the nucleus increases down the group, the greater \nshielding effect provided by extra inner shells of electrons \nand the larger distance of the outermost electrons from \nthe nucleus outweigh the attraction of the higher nuclear \ncharge. This helps to explain the increase in reactivity \ngoing down the group, as it gets easier for the atoms to \nform their 2+ ions.\nThe Group 2 metals get more reactive going down the \ngroup.\n\nReaction with oxygen\nThe Group 2 metals burn in air, and more rapidly in \noxygen, forming white solid oxides. For example, \nmagnesium ribbon burns with a bright white flame \nonce ignited in a Bunsen flame (Figure 11.5):\n2Mg(s)  +  O2(g) \n 2MgO(s)\nFigure 11.5  Magnesium ribbon reacting with oxygen \nin the air.\n166\nThe magnesium oxide formed is basic in character, as \nshown on page 156. Calcium oxide, CaO, reacts with \nwater to form calcium hydroxide. If water is dripped \nonto the surface of a lump of calcium oxide it causes \na vigorous reaction. It gives off so much heat that \nsome of the water boils off as the solid lump appears \nto expand and cracks open:\nCaO(s)  +  H2O(l) \n Ca(OH)2(s)\nReaction with water\nWe have seen on page 155 how magnesium reacts \nvery slowly with cold water but will eventually form a \nweakly alkaline solution:\nMg(s)  +  2H2O(l) \n Mg(OH)2(aq)  +  H2(g)\n\n---\n\nIn excess water, some of the slightly soluble calcium \nhydroxide dissolves to form a weakly alkaline \nsolution. The excess aqueous hydroxide ions in the \nsolution result in its pH of 11:\n water\nCa(OH)2(s) \n Ca2+(aq)  +  2OH−(aq)\nIn general, the reaction and dissolving of the Group 2 \nmetal oxides in water is described by the following \nionic equation:\nO2−(s)  +  H2O(l) \n 2OH−(aq)\nThe Group 2 metals get more reactive with oxygen \ngoing down the group. The larger atoms lose their \nouter two electrons more readily than the smaller \natoms in the group. The reasons for this are given \nbeneath Table 11.3.\nThe greater reactivity of barium metal is illustrated \nby the fact that it must be stored under oil to keep it \nout of contact with air.\nSome of the Group 2 metals burn with characteristic \nflame colours. It is the 2+ ions formed in the \nreaction that cause the colours. We can test for \ncalcium, strontium and barium in compounds \nusing flame tests. A nichrome wire, cleaned with \nconcentrated hydrochloric acid, is dipped into a \nsample of the salt to be tested and heated in a non-\nluminous Bunsen flame:\n■\n■\ncalcium compounds give a brick-red colour\n■\n■\nstrontium compounds give a scarlet/red colour\n■\n■\nbarium compounds give an apple-green colour.\nHot magnesium does react vigorously with water in \nthe form of steam to make magnesium oxide and \nhydrogen gas (Figure 11.6):\nMg(s)  +  H2O(g) \n MgO(s)  +  H2(g)\n\nReaction with water (continued)\nCalcium reacts more readily than magnesium with \nwater:\nCa(s)  +  2H2O(l) \n Ca(OH)2(aq)  +  H2(g)\nThis reaction forms a cloudy white suspension of \nslightly soluble calcium hydroxide. The calcium \nhydroxide that does dissolve makes the solution \nweakly alkaline. The hydrogen gas is given off at a \nsteady rate. Going down the group, hydrogen gas is \nreleased more and more rapidly by the reaction of \nthe element with water (Figure 11.7).\nThe resulting solutions also get more alkaline going down the \ngroup. We can explain this by looking at the solubility of \nthe hydroxides formed (see Table 11.4). Their solubility \nincreases on going down Group 2. Therefore when adding \nand stirring magnesium hydroxide in water to make a \nsaturated solution, then doing the same with barium \nhydroxide and water, there will be a higher concentration \nof hydroxide ions in the case of the saturated barium \nhydroxide solution. This results in a higher pH value for \nthe barium hydroxide solution.\nGroup 2 element\nSolubility of hydroxide at 298 K / mol / 100 g of water\nmagnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2\n2.0 × 10−5\ncalcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2\n1.5 × 10−3\nstrontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2\n3.4 × 10−3\nbarium hydroxide, Ba(OH)2\n1.5 × 10−2\n\n---\n\nFigure 11.6  An experiment showing magnesium reacting with steam.

For example, their sulfates become \nless soluble – so barium sulfate is much less soluble \nthan magnesium sulfate.

          "content": "Some uses of Group 2 \ncompounds\nWe have just seen how the Group 2 carbonates decompose \non heating. Limestone is made up mainly of calcium \ncarbonate. There are many types of limestone, which \nprovide useful rocks for building. They can be shaped \ninto blocks that can be stuck to each other using mortar. \nPreviously this mortar was made using lime and sand. \nNow it is more usual to use cement and sand, although the \ncement is made from lime – see below. Marble is another \nform of calcium carbonate used as a building material, for \nexample to make expensive tiles.\nHowever, most calcium carbonate is used to make \ncement. The first stage in the manufacture of cement is the \nroasting of limestone in a lime kiln (Figure 11.8). \nAt the high temperatures in the kiln, calcium carbonate \ndecomposes to form calcium oxide (also called lime \nor quicklime):\nheat\nCaCO3(s) \n CaO(s)  +  CO2(g)\nlime\nThe calcium oxide made in the lime kiln goes on to be \nroasted with clay to make cement. Cement can be mixed \nwith sand and small pieces of rock to make concrete, the \nmost widely used building material in the world. Its tensile \nstrength can be improved by letting the concrete set with \niron rods running through it.\nSlaked lime (calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2) is also \nused by farmers to raise the pH of acidic soil. Calcium \nhydroxide is basic, so it will react with and neutralise acid, \nraising the pH of the soil.\n\n---\n\n169\nFigure 11.8  In a rotating lime kiln, calcium carbonate \nundergoes thermal decomposition to form calcium oxide and \ncarbon dioxide.\nQuestion\n4\t a\t \u0007How is limestone turned into lime in industry?\nb\t \u0007Which major construction materials are made \nfrom cement?\nc\t\n\u0007Both calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide \nhave giant ionic structures.

This is due to \nthe addition of an extra shell of electrons for each \nelement as the group is descended.\n■ The Group 2 elements magnesium to barium react \nwith water to produce hydrogen gas and the metal \nhydroxide, which may be only slightly soluble.\n■ The Group 2 elements magnesium to barium burn \nin air to form white solid oxides. These oxides form \nhydroxides with water. The hydroxides get more \nsoluble in water going down the group so their \nsolutions can become more alkaline.\n170\nEnd-of-chapter questions\nYou will need a copy of the Periodic Table (see page 473) to answer some of these questions.\n\n---\n\n■ The sulfates of Group 2 elements get less soluble in \nwater going down the group.\n■ Reactivity of the elements with oxygen or water \nincreases down Group 2 as the first and second \nionisation energies decrease.\n■ The Group 2 carbonates and nitrates get more \nresistant to thermal decomposition descending \nthe group.\n■ Many of the compounds of Group 2 elements have \nimportant uses.

          "content": "Physical properties of Group 17 \nelements\nIn this chapter we will look at the elements in Group 17 \nof the Periodic Table, called the halogens.

At room \ntemperature, they exist as diatomic molecules, i.e. \nmolecules made up of two atoms, F2, Cl2, Br2 and I2 \n(Figure 12.2). There is a single covalent bond between the \ntwo atoms in each molecule.

          "content": "Reactions of Group 17 elements\nThe halogen atoms need to gain just one more electron to \nachieve the stable electronic configuration of the noble gas \natoms to the right of them in the Periodic Table. Therefore \nthey react with metallic elements, with each of their atoms \ngaining an electron from a metal atom to become ions \nwith a 1− charge. For example:\nCa(s)  +  Cl2(g) \n Ca2+Cl−\n2(s)\nWhen a halogen reacts with a metal atom, the halogen \natom gains one electron. Because of this, the halogens are \noxidising agents (electron acceptors). In the process of \noxidising another substance they themselves are reduced. \nTheir oxidation number is reduced from 0 in the element \nusually to −1 in the compound formed.\n\t Cl2 \n 2Cl−  +  2e−\noxidation number\t\n0\t\n−1\nThe halogens also react with many non-metals, each \nhalogen atom sharing a pair of electrons with the other \nnon-metal atom in a covalent bond, e.g. in hydrogen \nchloride, HCl.\nH2(g)  +  Cl2(g) \n 2HCl(g)\n\n---\n\nThe reactions of chlorine with calcium and with hydrogen \nshown here can be repeated with the other halogens. In \nthese experiments we find that the reactions of fluorine \nare more vigorous than those of chlorine. Bromine reacts \nless vigorously than chlorine, and iodine is less reactive \nthan bromine.\nThe halogens get less reactive going down Group 17.\nThis pattern in reactivity corresponds to the trend \nin electronegativity going down the group, shown in \nTable 12.2.\nHalogen\nElectronegativity\nfluorine (F)\n4.0\nchlorine (Cl)\n3.0\nbromine (Br)\n2.8\n173\niodine (I)\n2.5\nTable 12.2  Electronegativity values of the halogens.\nA fluorine atom has the strongest pull on the pair of \nelectrons in a covalent bond, while an iodine atom has \nthe weakest attraction for electrons. We can explain this \nby looking at the atomic radii data in Table 12.1. The \nfluorine atom is the smallest in the group. Its outer shell \nis nearer to the attractive force of the nucleus and an \nelectron entering its outer shell will also experience the \nleast shielding from the attraction of the positive nuclear \ncharge. These factors outweigh the fact that fluorine’s \nnuclear charge is only 9+ compared with iodine’s 53+. \nTherefore fluorine is a much stronger oxidising agent \n(acceptor of electrons) than iodine.\n\nDisplacement reactions\nWe can also judge the reactivity (or the oxidising \npower) of the halogens by looking at their displacement \nreactions with other halide ions in solution.\nA more reactive halogen can displace a less \nreactive halogen from a halide solution of the less \nreactive halogen.\nLet’s look at an example. When chlorine water, Cl2(aq), \nis added to a solution of sodium bromide, containing \nBr−(aq) ions, the solution changes to a yellowish \nbrown colour. The colour is caused by the presence \nof dissolved bromine molecules, Br2(aq), as found in \nbromine water. The displacement reaction that takes \nplace is:\nCl2(aq)  +  2NaBr(aq) \n 2NaCl(aq)  +  Br2(aq)\nWe say that chlorine has displaced bromine \nfrom solution.\nThis is summarised in the ionic equation for this \ndisplacement reaction:\n174\nCl2(aq)  +  2Br−(aq) \n 2Cl−(aq)  +  Br2(aq)\nthe chlorine atoms are more electronegative than \nbromine atoms so have a stronger tendency to form \nnegatively charged ions.\nLikewise, bromine will displace iodine from an \niodide solution:\nBr2(aq)  +  2NaI(aq) \n 2NaBr(aq)  +  I2(aq)\nor as an ionic equation:\nBr2(aq)  +  2I−(aq) \n 2Br−(aq)  +  I2(aq)\nQuestion\n2\t Chlorine water is mixed with a solution of potassium \niodide in a test tube. 2 cm3 of cyclohexane is added \nto the test tube, which is stoppered and shaken, then \nallowed to stand.\na\t \u0007Write a balanced symbol equation, including state \nsymbols, for the reaction that occurs.\nb\t \u0007Write an ionic equation for this reaction.\nc\t\n\u0007What colour is the cyclohexane layer at the end of \nthe experiment?\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the halogen molecules in solution \nare difficult to identify positively in these \ndisplacement reactions. However, the halogens \ndissolve well in cyclohexane (which is immiscible in \nwater, forming two separate layers). The halogens \ndissolved in cyclohexane are distinctly different \ncolours. Therefore adding some of this organic \nsolvent after mixing the halogen/halide solutions, \nshaking the mixture and then allowing it to settle \ninto layers shows clearly which halogen is present \nas its diatomic molecules (Figure 12.3).\nFigure 12.3  Cyclohexane forms a layer on top of water. \nDissolved iodine is purple in this upper organic layer, \nbromine is orange and chlorine is very pale green.\nReactions with hydrogen\nThe halogens form hydrogen halides with hydrogen \ngas. One example of this is the reaction of hydrogen \nwith chlorine to give hydrogen chloride (see page 173). \nThe trend in reactivity is illustrated by their reactions \n(Table 12.3).",

Without this dissolved oxygen they die, affecting \nthe whole ecosystem.\n184\nThis isn’t the only problem with fertilisers being leached \nfrom the soil. Nitrates have also been detected in our \ndrinking water, especially in agricultural areas. People are \nworried that nitrates in drinking water cause ‘blue baby’ \nsyndrome (when a newborn baby’s blood is starved of \noxygen), as well as stomach cancer. But others argue that \nlinks between nitrates and diseases have not been proven and \nthat recommended nitrate levels are set unrealistically low.\nFarmers can help limit the amount of nitrates in \nwater courses by adding the most economical amounts \nof fertilisers at the right time of year. This will minimise \nthe leaching of excess fertiliser from the soil and into our \nrivers and lakes.\nNitrogen oxides in the atmosphere\nAt the start of this chapter we saw how unreactive \nnitrogen gas is. However, in the extreme conditions in \na thunderstorm, lightning can trigger the reaction \nbetween nitrogen and oxygen to form gaseous nitrogen \noxides – nitrogen(II) oxide, NO and nitrogen(IV) oxide, \nNO2. A similar oxidation of nitrogen takes place inside \na car engine. In the engine’s cylinders a mixture of air \n\n---\n\n(mainly nitrogen plus oxygen) and fuel is compressed \nand ignited by a spark. Under these conditions (high \npressure and high temperature) nitrogen forms nitrogen \noxides. These are released into the atmosphere in the car’s \nexhaust fumes.\nNitrogen oxides are pollutants. They cause acid rain \nand photochemical smog. Nitrogen oxides also catalyse \nthe oxidation of sulfur dioxide gas, SO2, in the atmosphere \nduring the formation of acid rain. The sulfur trioxide, SO3, \ngas that is produced by this oxidation reacts with rainwater, \nforming sulfuric acid. The reactions below show the \ncatalytic activity of the nitrogen oxides:\nSO2(g)  +  NO2(g) \n SO3(g)  +  NO(g)\nThen NO2 is regenerated as NO reacts with oxygen in \nthe air:\nNO(g)  +  ​ 1 _ \n2 ​ O2(g) \n NO2(g)\nThis NO2 molecule can then go on to oxidise another \nsulfur dioxide molecule, at the same time producing an NO \nmolecule to make another NO2 molecule. this will oxidise \nanother sulfur dioxide molecule, and so on. Therefore NO2 \ncatalyses the oxidation of SO2.\nNowadays, car exhaust systems are fitted with catalytic \nconverters to help reduce the pollutants from motor \nvehicles (see page 205). The reaction on the surface of the \nhot catalyst (e.g. platinum) reduces the nitrogen oxides to \nharmless nitrogen gas, which is released from the vehicle’s \nexhaust pipe.\n2CO(g)  +  2NO(g) \n 2CO2(g)  +  N2(g)\nQuestion\n3\t a\t \u0007Why is ammonia so important in providing enough \nfood to feed the world?\nb\t \u0007Give one environmental problem and one possible \nhealth problem associated with nitrate fertilisers.\nc\t\n\u0007Explain how nitrogen oxides are involved in the \nformation of atmospheric sulfur trioxide (SO3).\nd\t \u0007The following reaction takes place in a car’s \ncatalytic converter once it is warmed up:\n2CO(g)  +  2NO(g) \n 2CO2(g)  +  N2(g)\n\u0007Use oxidation numbers to explain which species is \nreduced and which is oxidised in the reaction.",

The more alkyl \ngroups adjacent to the positively charged carbon atom, the \nmore stable the carbocation.\nThe type of carbocation formed in a reaction mechanism \ncan affect the products formed in some organic reactions, \nsuch as addition reactions to alkenes (see page 208). \nAlkyl groups (e.g.  \n CH3,  \n C2H5,  \n C3H7, etc.) tend \nto ‘push’ the electrons away from themselves. We say \nthat the electron-donating nature of alkyl groups has a \npositive inductive effect on adjacent groups. Therefore, \nin carbocations the more alkyl groups attached to the \npositively charged carbon, the less the charge density is on \nthe carbon atom with the three covalent bonds. Organic \nintermediates formed in the course of a reaction are \nenergetically more stable when any charge on a species is \nnot concentrated in one place but is spread over several \natoms. So when carbocations are formed as intermediates \nin reactions, the tertiary carbocation is most likely to form \nas its positive charge is, in effect, ‘smeared’ over the C+ \natom and the three carbon atoms it is bonded to.\nCarbocations are an example of a species called \nan electrophile.\nAn electrophile is an acceptor of a pair of electrons.\n\n---\n\nWhen an electrophile accepts a pair of electrons this \nresults in the formation of a new covalent bond (see \npage 209).\nYou will also meet nucleophiles when studying organic \nreactions. These are electron-rich species, i.e. they carry a \nnegative, or partial negative, charge.\nA nucleophile is a donator of a pair of electrons.\nWhen a nucleophile donates a pair of electrons, this leads \nto the formation of a new covalent bond with the electron-\ndeficient atom under attack (see page 237).\nQuestion\n11\t a\t \u0007Write an equation to show the homolytic fission of \nthe Cl \n Cl bond in a chlorine molecule, Cl2.\nb\t \u0007Write an equation to show the heterolytic fission of \nthe C \n Cl bond in chloromethane.

          "content": "Reactions of alkanes\nThe alkanes are generally unreactive compounds. \nThis can be explained by the very small difference in \nelectronegativity between carbon and hydrogen. The \nalkane molecules are non-polar, so they are not attacked \nby nucleophiles or electrophiles. They have no partial \npositive charges on any of their carbon atoms to attract \nnucleophiles, neither do they have areas of high electron \ndensity to attract electrophiles (see page 197).\nHowever, the alkanes do react with oxygen in \ncombustion reactions and also undergo substitution by \nhalogens in sunlight. These reactions are covered in the \nnext sections.\n204\nFigure 15.5  Non-polar alkanes do not react with polar \ncompounds such as water. The hexane (which is dyed with \niodine to make it more clearly visible) and water shown here \nare immiscible – they do not mix and they do not react with \neach other.\nCombustion of alkanes\nAlkanes are often used as fuels (Figure 15.6). We burn \nthem for many reasons:\n■\n■\nto generate electricity in power stations\n■\n■\nto heat our homes and cook our food\n■\n■\nto provide energy needed in industrial processes\n■\n■\nto provide power for ships, aeroplanes, trains, lorries, \nbuses, cars and motorbikes.\nIf an alkane is burnt in plenty of oxygen, it will undergo \ncomplete combustion. The carbon will be oxidised fully to \nform carbon dioxide and the hydrogen will be oxidised to \nform water:\ncomplete\ncombustion\nalkane  +  oxygen \n carbon dioxide  +  water\n\n---\n\nFigure 15.6  Alkanes are useful fuels.\nFor example, octane can be found in petrol. Some of it will \nundergo complete combustion in a car engine:\noctane +\noxygen\ncarbon dioxide +\nwater\n2C8H18 +\n25O2\n16CO2\n+ 18H2O\nThe equation can also be written as:\nC8H18\n+\n12​ 1 _ \n2 ​ O2\n8CO2\n+\n9H2O\nPollution from burning hydrocarbon \nfuels\nWhen the petrol or diesel is mixed with air inside a car \nengine, there is a limited supply of oxygen. Under these \nconditions, not all the carbon in the hydrocarbon fuel is \nfully oxidised to carbon dioxide. Some of the carbon is \nonly partially oxidised to form carbon monoxide gas. This \nis called incomplete combustion. For example:\nincomplete \ncombustion\noctane + oxygen\ncarbon monoxide + water\n2C8H18 +\n17O2\n16CO\n+ 18H2O\nor\nC8H18 +\n8​ 1 _ \n2 ​ O2\n8CO\n+ 9H2O\nCarbon monoxide is a toxic gas that bonds with \nthe haemoglobin in your blood. The haemoglobin \nmolecules can then no longer bond to oxygen and so \ncannot transport oxygen around your body. Victims of \ncarbon monoxide poisoning will feel dizzy, then lose \nconsciousness. If not removed from the toxic gas, the \nvictim will die. Carbon monoxide is odourless, so this\n\nadds to the danger. This is why faulty gas heaters in which \nincomplete combustion occurs can kill unsuspecting \npeople in rooms with poor ventilation.\nAs well as carbon monoxide, road traffic also releases \nacidic nitrogen oxides. These contribute to the problem of \nacid rain. Acid rain can kill trees and aquatic animals in \nlakes (Figure 15.7). Acid raid also corrodes metals, such \nas iron.\nFigure 15.7  These trees have been badly damaged by \nacid rain.\nIn normal combustion, nitrogen gas in the air does not get \noxidised. However, in the very high temperatures in car \nengines oxidation of nitrogen does take place. A variety \nof nitrogen oxides can be formed and released in the car’s \nexhaust fumes (Figure 15.8). For example:\nN2(g)  +  O2(g) \n 2NO(g)\n\n---\n\nAs well as toxic carbon monoxide and acidic nitrogen \noxides, cars also release unburnt hydrocarbons, often \nreferred to as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the \nair. Some of these are carcinogens (they cause cancers).\nCars can now be fitted with a catalytic converter in \ntheir exhaust system (Figure 15.9). Once warmed up, a \ncatalytic converter can cause the following reactions to \ntake place:\n■\n■\nthe oxidation of carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide\n■\n■\nthe reduction of nitrogen oxides to form harmless \nnitrogen gas\n■\n■\nthe oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons to form carbon \ndioxide and water.\nUnfortunately, catalytic converters can do nothing to \nreduce the amount of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) \ngiven off in the exhaust gases of cars.\n205\nFigure 15.9  Catalytic converters reduce the pollutants from \ncar exhausts. Precious metals, such as platinum, are coated \non a honeycomb structure to provide a large surface area on \nwhich the reactions can occur.\nThe following equation describes the reaction between \ncarbon monoxide and nitrogen monoxide. It takes \nplace on the surface of the precious metal catalyst in a \ncatalytic converter:\n2CO  +  2NO \n 2CO2  +  N2\n\nhuge increase in the amount of CO2 produced by human \nactivity in the last 200 years. This extra CO2 traps more \nheat, and most scientists accept that this is causing the \naverage temperature of the Earth to rise. This increase in \ntemperature could cause rising sea levels, resulting in \nthe flooding of low-lying areas of land. The climate will \nalso change around the world, with more extreme \nweather predicted.\nEnvironmental scientists can monitor the pollutant \ngases in the air using an instrumental technique called \ninfrared spectroscopy (see Chapter 18, page 241). It works \nquickly and accurately to monitor pollutants, including \nnitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide \nand carbon dioxide, as well as more than a hundred \nVOCs and low-level ozone. The scientists can use the \ncharacteristic wavelengths of infrared radiation absorbed \nby the molecules of the pollutants to identify them. They \ncan also analyse the intensity of the absorptions to find \nthe concentration of each pollutant present in a sample. \nMonitored over a period of time, the scientists provide \nuseful information on the effectiveness of pollution control \nmeasures introduced locally and on a global level.\nSubstitution reactions of alkanes\n206\nquestions\n3\t a\t \u0007What would happen if octane was added to a \nsolution of sodium hydroxide?\nb\t \u0007Explain your answer to part a.\n4\t Give the balanced symbol equations for:\na\t \u0007the complete combustion of heptane, C7H16, giving \ncarbon dioxide and water\nb\t \u0007the incomplete combustion of methane, CH4, \ngiving carbon monoxide and water\nc\t\n\u0007the incomplete combustion of nonane, C9H20.\n5\t a\t \u0007Name two pollutants from a car engine that are \noxidised in a catalytic converter.\nb\t \u0007Name a pollutant that is reduced in a catalytic \nconverter.\nc\t\n\u0007Which pollutant from a car engine is not \ndiminished by the use of a catalytic converter? \nWhat environmental problem does this pollutant \ncontribute to?\nd\t \u0007What information about air pollution can the \ntechnique of infrared spectroscopy reveal to an \nenvironmental scientist?\n\n---\n\nThe alkanes will undergo substitution reactions with \nhalogens in sunlight. For example:\nsunlight\n CH4  +  Cl2 \n CH3Cl  +  HCl\nmethane\t\nchloromethane\nIn this reaction a hydrogen atom in the methane molecule \ngets replaced by a chlorine atom. However, the reaction \ndoes not take place in darkness (Figure 15.10). So what \nrole does the sunlight play in the mechanism of the \nsubstitution reaction?\nhexane + bromine\nmix and\nleave in\nsunlight\nmix and place\nin a dark\ncupboard\nno reaction\nreaction to give a\nmixture of bromohexanes\n– bromine colour disappears\nFigure 15.10  A substitution reaction takes place between \nalkanes and bromine in sunlight, but there is no reaction in \ndarkness.\nInitiation step\nThe first step in the mechanism is the breaking of the \nCl \n Cl bond by ultraviolet light from the Sun. This is an \nexample of homolytic fission of a covalent bond (see page \n196). This is called the initiation step in the mechanism:\nUV light\nCl2 \n 2Cl \nAs the Cl \n Cl bond breaks, each chlorine atom takes one \nelectron from the pair of electrons in the Cl \n Cl bond. \nTwo Cl atoms are formed. These Cl atoms, each with an \nunpaired electron, are called free radicals.\nPropagation steps\nFree radicals are very reactive. They will attack the \nnormally unreactive alkanes. A chlorine free radical will \nattack the methane molecule:\nCH4  +  Cl \n CH3  +  HCl\n\nhomolytically. A methyl free radical, CH3, is produced. \nThis can then attack a chlorine molecule, forming \nchloromethane and regenerating a chlorine free radical:\nCH3  +  Cl2 \n CH3Cl  +  Cl \nThen the first propagation step can be repeated as the \nchlorine free radical can attack another methane molecule. \nThis forms the methyl free radical, which regenerates \nanother chlorine free radical, and so on …\nThe word ‘propagation’ usually refers to growing \nnew plants. In this mechanism the substitution reaction \nprogresses (grows) in a kind of chain reaction.\nThis reaction is not really suitable for preparing \nspecific halogenoalkanes, because we get a mixture of \nsubstitution products. In the reaction between methane \nand chlorine, the products can include dichloromethane, \ntrichloromethane and tetrachloromethane as well \nas chloromethane. These other products result from \npropagation steps in which a chlorine free radical attacks a \nhalogenoalkane already formed.

          "content": "Introduction\nHalogenoalkanes are used in many industrial chemical \nprocesses. Unlike some of the elements from which \nthey are formed, such as fluorine and chlorine, many \nFigure 16.1  An anaesthetist putting a patient to sleep before \nan operation.\nNucleophilic substitution \nreactions\n218\nWe can think of the halogenoalkanes as alkanes that have \none or more hydrogen atoms replaced by halogen atoms.\nRemember that the halogens are the elements in Group \n17 of the Periodic Table, namely fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), \nbromine (Br) and iodine (I).\nThe simplest halogenoalkanes, whose molecules contain \njust one halogen atom, will have the general formula \nCnH2n + 1X, where X is F, Cl, Br or I. The presence of the \nhalogen atom has a huge effect on the reactivity of the \nhalogenoalkanes compared with that of the alkanes.\n\n---\n\nhalogenoalkanes are relatively unreactive under \nnormal conditions. This leads to their use as flame \nretardants and anaesthetics.\nIf you have ever had an operation, you may have a \nhalogenoalkane to thank for putting you to sleep. \nYou might have heard of an early anaesthetic called \nchloroform. Its systematic name is trichloromethane. \nNowadays you may receive a gas known as ‘halothane’:\nF\nCl\nC\nF\nC\nBr\nF\nH\nHowever, under other conditions, such as high in the \nEarth’s stratosphere, some halogenoalkanes react in \ncompletely different ways.\n1  Substitution reactions with aqueous \nalkali, OH–(aq)\nWhen an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide is added \nto a halogenoalkane, a nucleophilic substitution reaction \ntakes place. The halogen atom in the halogenoalkane \nis replaced by an \n OH, hydroxyl group, so the organic \nproduct formed is an alcohol:\nCH3CH2Br  +  NaOH \n CH3CH2OH  +  NaBr\n\t bromoethane\t\nethanol\nWe can also show this equation as:\nCH3CH2Br  +  OH– \n CH3CH2OH  +  Br–\nThe aqueous hydroxide ion behaves as a nucleophile here, \nbecause it is donating a pair of electrons to the carbon \natom bonded to the halogen in the halogenoalkane. This is \nwhy the reaction is called a nucleophilic substitution.\n\nHydrolysis of a halogenoalkane\nThe reaction is carried out under reflux in the \nlaboratory. This enables us to heat the reaction \nmixture without evaporating off the volatile \norganic compounds in the reaction flask. The \napparatus is shown in Figure 16.2.\nwater out\ncondenser\nwater in\nhalogenoalkane\n+\nalkali (OH–)\nanti-bumping\ngranules\nheat\nFigure 16.2  Reflux apparatus for hydrolysis \nof a halogenoalkane.\nSimilar reactions occur with other \nhalogenoalkanes, but the reaction rates differ. \nWe can investigate the rate of hydrolysis using \naqueous silver nitrate solution. The water in the \nsilver nitrate solution acts as the nucleophile, \nand again an alcohol is formed. The reaction is \ncalled hydrolysis (meaning ‘breakdown by water’): \nCH3CH2Br  +  H2O \n CH3CH2OH  +  H+  +  Br –\nIt is a very similar reaction to the reaction that \ntakes place with aqueous alkali.\nHowever, the hydrolysis with water occurs more \nslowly than with OH–(aq). This is because the \nnegatively charged hydroxide ion is a more effective \nnucleophile than a neutral water molecule.\nFrom the equation above, you can see that a halide \nion, in this case Br –, is produced in the reaction. \n\n---\n\nOn page 175 we used silver nitrate solution to test for \nhalide ions. Remember that aqueous chlorides give a \nwhite precipitate (silver chloride), bromides give a cream \nprecipitate (silver bromide) and iodides produce a pale \nyellow precipitate (silver iodide). The water in the silver \nnitrate solution will hydrolyse a halogenoalkane.\nObserving this reaction, we can time how long it takes \nfor test tubes containing the halogenoalkanes and aqueous \nsilver nitrate solution to become opaque.\nWe find that:\n■\n■\nthe fastest nucleophilic substitution reactions take place \nwith the iodoalkanes\n■\n■\nthe slowest nucleophilic substitution reactions take place \nwith the fluoroalkanes.\nThe substitution reaction involves the breaking of the \ncarbon   halogen bond. Looking at the bond energies \nFluoroalkanes\t\nleast reactive\nChloroalkanes\t\nBromoalkanes\t\nIodoalkanes\t\nmost reactive\n219\n(Table 16.1) helps us to explain the rates of reaction. Notice \nthat the C– I bond is the weakest, so it is broken most \neasily. It forms an I– ion during the substitution reaction. \nThis is shown clearly in an ionic equation:\nCH3CH2I  +  OH– \n CH3CH2OH  +  I–\n\tiodooethane\t\nethanol\nThere is more about the mechanism of nucleophilic \nsubstitution on pages 220–1.\nBond\nBond energy / kJ mol–1\nC    F\n467 (strongest bond)\nC    Cl\n346\nC    Br\n290\nC    I\n228 (weakest bond)\nTable 16.1  Bond energy values of the carbon–halogen bonds.\n2  Substitution with cyanide ions, CN– \n(in ethanol)\nIn this reaction the nucleophile is the cyanide, CN–, ion. \nTo carry out the reaction, a solution of potassium cyanide, \nKCN, in ethanol (known as an ethanolic or alcoholic\n\nsolution of potassium cyanide) is made up. This is then \nheated under reflux with the halogenoalkane. An ionic \nequation for this reaction is:\nCH3CH2Br  +  CN– \n CH3CH2CN  +  Br–\n\t bromoethane\t\npropanenitrile\nNote that in the reaction with the cyanide ion, an extra \ncarbon atom is added to the original halogenoalkane chain. \nIn this case, bromoethane is converted to propanenitrile.\nSometimes in industry chemists need to make a new \ncompound with one more carbon atom than the best \navailable organic raw material (the starting compound). \nTherefore, if we can convert the starting compound to a \nhalogenoalkane, we can then reflux with ethanolic KCN to \nmake a nitrile. We now have an intermediate nitrile with \nthe correct number of carbon atoms. \nWe will consider nitriles and their subsequent \nconversion to carboxylic acids and amines again in \nChapter 18, page 231.\n3  Substitution with ammonia, NH3 \n(in ethanol)\nIf a halogenoalkane is heated with an excess of ammonia \ndissolved in ethanol under pressure, an amine is formed.\n220\nCH3CH2Br  +  NH3 \n CH3CH2NH2  +  HBr\n\t bromoethane\t\nethylamine\nHere the nucleophile is the ammonia molecule. \nEthylamine is a primary amine, as the nitrogen atom is \nattached to only one alkyl group. If the ammonia is not \nin excess, we get a mixture of amine products. This \nis because the primary amine product will act as a \nnucleophile itself and will attack halogenoalkane \nmolecules, forming secondary amines, and so on. The \nsecondary amine formed above would be (CH3CH2)2NH, \ncalled diethylamine. You can read more about amines in \nChapter 27, page 401.\nquestions\n1\t \u0007a\t \u0007Why does the hydrolysis of a halogenoalkane \nhappen more quickly with OH–(aq) ions than with \nwater molecules?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Explain why silver nitrate solution can be used \nto investigate the rate of hydrolysis of the \nhalogenoalkanes.

In these reactions, the nucleophile attacks \nthe carbon atom bonded to the halogen. Remember from \nChapter 14 that nucleophiles are donors of an electron pair \nand are attracted to electron-deficient atoms.\nThe carbon–halogen bond is polarised because the \nhalogen is more electronegative than carbon. Therefore \nthe carbon atom carries a partial positive charge as the \nelectron pair in the carbon–halogen bond is drawn \nnearer to the halogen atom (shown in Figure 16.3). \nThe halogen atom is replaced by the nucleophile in the \nsubstitution reaction.\nH\nδ+\nC\nδ–\nX\nH\nH\nFigure 16.3  The carbon–halogen bond is polarised.\nThere are two possible mechanisms that can operate in the \nnucleophilic substitution reactions of halogenoalkanes. \nThe mechanism is determined by the structure of the \nhalogenoalkane involved in the reaction.\nMechanism for primary halogenoalkanes \n(SN2)\nIn primary halogenoalkanes containing one halogen \natom, the halogen atom is bonded to a carbon atom, \nwhich is itself bonded to one other carbon atom and \ntwo hydrogen atoms.

The ‘S’ \nstands for substitution and the ‘N’ stands for nucleophilic. \nThe ‘2’ tells us that the rate of the reaction, which is \ndetermined by the slow step in the mechanism (see page \n141), involves two reacting species.

These properties made volatile \nCFCs useful as aerosol propellants, solvents and as the \nrefrigerants inside fridges. They were also used as blowing \nagents for polymers such as expanded polystyrene.\n\nDichlorodifluoromethane is an example of a CFC used for \nthese purposes.\nWhen the compounds were discovered in the 1930s, \npeople could see no drawbacks to using the new ‘wonder \ncompounds’. However, CFCs have caused a serious \nenvironmental issue – the depletion of the ozone layer in \nthe upper atmosphere. The ozone layer protects the Earth by \nabsorbing harmful UV radiation arriving from the Sun.\nIt turns out that CFCs are unreactive in normal \nconditions, but high up in the atmosphere they become \ntotally different. The CFCs can persist in the atmosphere \nfor about a hundred years. They diffuse up to the \nstratosphere – and that’s where the problem starts. The \nUV light from the Sun breaks the C   Cl bonds in the \nCFC molecules. This releases highly reactive chlorine \natoms, called chlorine free radicals. These chlorine free \nradicals react with ozone molecules. In a sequence of \nchain reactions, it has been estimated that each chlorine \nfree radical can destroy a million ozone molecules \n(Figure 16.8).\nGovernments have tackled the problem, and most \nindustrialised countries have now banned the use of CFCs. \nChemists developed new compounds for fridges and \naerosols, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs): for example, \nCH2FCF3. These non-chlorinated compounds break down \nmore quickly once released into the air because of the \npresence of hydrogen in their molecules, so they never rise \nin the atmosphere as far as the ozone layer. There are now \nsigns that the ozone layer is recovering from the effects of \nCFCs. The hole in the ozone layer is very slowly closing up.\nSummary\n■\t If one or more of the hydrogen atoms in an alkane \nmolecule are replaced by halogen atoms, the \ncompound is called a halogenoalkane.\n■\t Iodoalkanes are the most reactive halogenoalkanes, \nwhereas fluoroalkanes are the least reactive.

This \nreduces the use of petrol.\n\nA country like Brazil has few oil reserves but can grow plenty \nof sugar cane, which can be fermented to make ethanol, \nwhich is used as a fuel either in pure form or in mixtures with \nother fuels (Figure 17.3). As well as conserving the world’s \ndiminishing supplies of crude oil, sugar cane has the advantage \nof absorbing CO2 as it grows. Although the CO2 is effectively \nreturned to the atmosphere during fermentation and when the \nethanol burns, biofuels such as ethanol are said to be ‘carbon \nneutral’. Overall, they do not increase the greenhouse gases \nin the air (in theory). Even if we take into account the CO2 \nproduced in growing, harvesting, transporting and processing \nthe sugar cane, it is still much better for the environment to use \n‘bio-ethanol’ as a fuel than petrol or diesel from crude oil.\nFigure 17.3  The fuel called ‘gasohol’ is a mixture of ethanol \nand petrol.\nEthanol is used as a solvent as well as a fuel. We often use it \nas ‘methylated spirits’, which contains about 90% ethanol.\nQuestion\n2\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write a balanced equation for the complete \ncombustion of:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007propan-1-ol\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007butan-1-ol.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Glucose can be fermented with yeast in anaerobic \nconditions. Name the products of the reaction.\n\n---\n\natom open to nucleophilic attack. The initial attack on the \nalcohol is by the partially negative halogen atom in the \nhydrogen halide:\nδ+\nH\nδ–\nX\nwhere X = halogen atom\nalcohol + hydrogen halide \n halogenoalkane + water \nFor example:\n\tCH3CH2OH + HCl \n CH3CH2Cl + 3H2O\nethanol\t\nchloroethane\nThe dry hydrogen chloride gas for this reaction can be \nmade in situ (in the reaction vessel). Sodium chloride and \nconcentrated sulfuric acid are used for this:\nNaCl  +  H2SO4 \n NaHSO4  +  HCl\nHalogenation of an alcohol\nThe alcohol is heated under reflux (see apparatus \non page 219) with the reactants to make the \nhalogenoalkane. The halogenoalkane made can \nthen be distilled off from the reaction mixture and \ncollected as oily droplets under water (Figure 17.4).\n227\nFigure 17.4  Bromoethane being distilled off following \nthe reaction between ethanol and hydrogen bromide. \nThe white solid visible in the pear-shaped flask is sodium \nbromide (as crystals). The sodium bromide reacts with \nconcentrated sulfuric acid to make the hydrogen bromide \nneeded for the reaction.\n\nSulfur dichloride oxide, SOCl2, can also be used to \nsubstitute a chlorine atom into an alcohol molecule, as \nshown below:\nC2H5OH  +  SOCl2 \n C2H5Cl  +  HCl  +  SO2\nNote that in this reaction the two byproducts of the \nreaction (HCl and SO2) are both gases. These escape from \nthe reaction mixture, leaving the halogenoalkane, without \nthe need to distil it off as in the hydrogen halide reaction.\nWe can also use phosphorus halides to provide the \nhalogen atoms for this substitution reaction.\nFor chloroalkanes we can use solid phosphorus(V) \nchloride, PCl5:\n room temperature\nC2H5OH  +  PCl5 \n C2H5Cl  +  HCl  +  POCl3\nThe release of acidic hydrogen chloride gas from this \nreaction can be used as a test for the hydroxyl group. The \nHCl gas causes acidic ‘steamy fumes’ to be observed.\nPhosphorus(III) chloride can also be used to halogenate \nan alcohol, but this reaction does require heating.\nFor bromoalkanes and iodoalkanes we can make \nthe phosphorus(III) halide, PBr3 or PI3, in situ using red \nphosphorus and bromine or iodine. These are warmed \nwith the alcohol. For example:\n228\n3C2H5OH  +  PI3 \n 3C2H5I  +  H3PO3\niodoethane\nQuestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write a balanced equation to show the reaction \nbetween ethanol and hydrogen bromide.\n\u0007b\t \u0007What are the reagents and conditions used for \nthis reaction?\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007What do we call this type of reaction?\n3  Reaction with sodium metal\nIn the reaction with hydrogen halides, the C   O bond in \nthe alcohol breaks. However, in some other reactions the \nO   H bond in the alcohol breaks. The reaction with \nsodium metal is an example:\nC2H5OH  +  Na \n C2H5O–Na+  +  H2\nethanol\t\nsodium\t\nsodium ethoxide\t hydrogen\nThe reaction is similar to sodium’s reaction with water, but \nless vigorous. In both cases hydrogen gas is given off and \n\n---\n\na basic ionic compound is formed. With ethanol, if the \nexcess ethanol is evaporated off after the reaction, a white \ncrystalline solid is left. This is the sodium ethoxide.\nOther alcohols react in a similar way with sodium. For \nexample, propan-1-ol would produce sodium propoxide \nplus hydrogen gas. \nIn general:\nalcohol  +  sodium \n sodium alkoxide  +  hydrogen\nWe find that the longer the hydrocarbon chain, the less \nvigorous the reaction.\nFigure 17.5  Sodium reacting with ethanol. The pink colour \nis from a colourless phenolphthalein indicator that has been \nadded to the ethanol, showing the basic nature of the sodium \nethoxide formed.\nQuestion\n4\t \u0007Lithium reacts with alcohols in a similar way to \nsodium. A small piece of lithium metal is dropped onto \na watch-glass containing propan-1-ol.\n\u0007a\t \u0007What would you observe?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Name the products of the reaction.\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007What difference would you expect to see if you \nused sodium instead of lithium in this reaction?\n\n4  Esterification\nAlcohol plus carboxylic acid\nAnother reaction that involves the breaking of the \nO   H bond in alcohols is esterification, i.e. the \nmaking of esters. An esterification reaction is usually \nbetween an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. The \ngeneral equation is:\nacid catalyst\ncarboxylic acid  +  alcohol \n ester  +  water\nFor this reaction to take place, the carboxylic acid \nand alcohol are heated under reflux with a strong \nacid catalyst (usually concentrated sulfuric acid). \nThe reaction is reversible, so an equilibrium can \nbe established with all the reactants and products \nshown in the general equation present.\nThe esters formed usually have sweet, fruity smells. \nThey are present naturally in fruits, and we use \nthem in artificial flavourings and perfumes \n(Figure 17.6). They are also used as solvents, e.g. in \nnail varnish remover.\nHere is an example of an esterification reaction:\nO\nH2SO 4\nO\nCH3C\nC2H5OH\nH2O\n+\n+\nCH3C\nOH\nOC2H5\nethanoic acid\nethyl ethanoate\nwater\nethanol\nThe ester formed is called ethyl ethanoate.\nWhat would be the name of the ester formed if \nethanol was reacted with propanoic acid? Would it be \npropyl ethanoate or ethyl propanoate? The answer \n\n---\n\nFigure 17.6  Esters contribute to the complex mixture of \nsubstances blended in a perfume.\n229\nis ethyl propanoate. That’s because the first part of \nan ester’s name comes from the alcohol: in this case \nethanol, giving ‘ethyl …’. The second part comes \nfrom the carboxylic acid, in this case propanoic acid, \ngiving ‘… propanoate’, thus making the name of the \nester formed ‘ethyl propanoate’:\nCH3CH2COOH  +  C2H5OH\n\t propanoic acid\t\nethanol\nH2SO4 CH3CH2COOC2H5  +  H2O\n\t ethyl propanoate\t\nwater\nO\nO\nH+(aq)\n+ H2O\nH3C\nH3C\nC\n+ CH3CH2OH\nC\nCH2CH3\nH\nO\nO\nHowever, when an ester is refluxed with an alkali (a \nsoluble base), such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, it is \nfully hydrolysed. Unlike acid hydrolysis, this is not a \nreversible reaction, so all the ester present can be broken \ndown by excess alkali. An alcohol and the sodium salt of \nthe carboxylic acid are formed. The equation for the base \nhydrolysis of ethyl ethanoate is:\n\nO\nO\n+ CH3CH2OH\nH3C\nCH2CH3\nH3C\nC\nC\n+ NaOH\nO–\nNa+\nO\nsodium\nethanoate\nQuestion\n5\t \u0007a\t \u0007Name the ester formed in each of the following \nreactions:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007butan-1-ol + ethanoic acid\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007ethanol + hexanoic acid\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007pentan-1-ol and methanoic acid.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Write the structural formula of each ester formed \nin part a.\n5  Dehydration\nAlcohols can also undergo elimination reactions in which \nwater is lost and alkenes are formed. As the small molecule \nremoved from the alcohol molecule is H2O, this reaction is \nalso known as dehydration.\ncatalyst\nalcohol \n alkene  +  water\n230\nThe reaction takes place when alcohol vapour is passed \nover a hot catalyst of aluminium oxide powder. Pieces of \nporous pot or pumice also catalyse the reaction. \nFor example:\nAl2O3 catalyst\nC2H5OH \n CH2\n  CH2  +  H2O\nethanol\t\nethene\t\nwater\nFigure 17.7 shows how the ethene gas formed can \nbe collected.\nceramic wool\nsoaked in ethanol\npumice\nethene gas collected\nover water\nheat\n\n---\n\nQuestion\n6\t \u0007Concentrated sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid can also \nbe used to catalyse the dehydration of an alcohol. \nThe alcohol and concentrated acid are heated to \nabout 170 °C. The concentrated acid does not change \nchemically during the reaction.\n\u0007a\t \u0007Write an equation showing the dehydration of \nethanol using concentrated sulfuric acid.\n\u0007b\t \u0007If propan-1-ol was used instead of ethanol, name \nthe organic product formed.\n6  Oxidation\nOn page 226 we saw how alcohols can be classified as \nprimary, secondary or tertiary. For many of their reactions, \nthe class of alcohol makes no difference to the type of \nproducts formed. In organic chemistry, we can usually \ngeneralise for the whole homologous series. However, when \nalcohols are oxidised, different products are obtained from \nprimary, secondary and tertiary alcohols.\nAlcohols can be oxidised by potassium dichromate(VI) \nsolution, K2Cr2O7, acidified with dilute sulfuric acid. The \nsolution’s orange colour is caused by the dichromate(VI) \nions, Cr2O7\n2–(aq). When the dichromate(VI) ions react as \nan oxidising agent, they themselves are reduced and turn \ninto chromium(III) ions, Cr3+(aq), which form a green \nsolution. The reaction mixture needs to be warmed before \nthe oxidation takes place.\nThe product formed when an alcohol is oxidised can \nbe used to distinguish between primary, secondary and \ntertiary alcohols. You can learn about the chemical tests \nfor the products on pages 238–9.\n■\n■\nWith tertiary alcohols, a mixture of the tertiary alcohol, \ndilute sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate(VI) solution \nremains orange when warmed. No reaction takes place \nunder these relatively mild conditions.\n■\n■\nA secondary alcohol, such as propan-2-ol, will be oxidised \nto form a ketone. In this case propanone is formed and the \nreaction mixture turns green:\nOH\nO\nC\nCH3 + [O] ⎯→\nH3C\nC\nH3C\nCH3 + H2O\npropanone\nH\nThese oxidation equations use [O] to show the oxygen \nadded from the oxidising agent. You have met this type \nof simplified equation for oxidation reactions before on \npage 198.\n\n■\n■\nWith a primary alcohol, such as ethanol, the alcohol is \noxidised to an aldehyde. Ethanol is oxidised to ethanal:\nO\nethanal\nCH3CH2OH + [O]\nC\n⎯→H3C\nH + H2O \nThe ethanal formed can be further oxidised to form \nethanoic acid, a carboxylic acid. This is achieved by \nrefluxing with excess acidified potassium dichromate(VI):\nO\nO\nethanoic acid\nH3C\nC\nH + [O] ⎯→\nH3C\nOH\nC\nDistinguishing tertiary alcohols\nGiven three unknown alcohols, one primary, one \nsecondary and one tertiary, it would be easy to \ndistinguish the tertiary alcohol. Figure 17.8 shows \nthe results of warming each class of alcohol with \na solution of acidified potassium dichromate(VI). \nMore details of these reactions are given on page \n236.\nFigure 17.8  Before warming with the labelled alcohol, \neach of these tubes contained orange acidified \npotassium dichromate(VI) solution. After warming, \nthe orange dichromate(VI) ions have been reduced to \ngreen chromium(III) ions by the primary and secondary \nalcohols. This shows that both the primary and \nsecondary alcohols have been oxidised but the tertiary \nalcohol, 2-methylpropan-2-ol, has not.\n\n---\n\nQuestion\n7\t \u0007Propan-1-ol can be oxidised to propanal, CH3CH2CHO, \nand then to propanoic acid, CH3CH2COOH.\n\u0007a\t \u0007What reagents and conditions should be used to \noxidise propan-1-ol to propanal?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Write a balanced chemical equation for this \noxidation. Oxygen from the oxidising agent should \nbe shown as [O].\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007What reagents and conditions should be used to \noxidise propan-1-ol to propanoic acid?\n\u0007d\t \u0007Write a balanced chemical equation for this \noxidation. Again, show oxygen from the oxidising \nagent as [O].\nCarboxylic acids\nReactions that form carboxylic acids\nWe have already seen how primary alcohols can be \noxidised to aldehydes and then further oxidation of the \naldehyde formed yields the carboxylic acid.\nCarboxylic acids are also made from nitriles, \nR     C     N. When a nitrile is refluxed with dilute \nhydrochloric acid hydrolysis occurs, and the \n  C     N \ngroup at the end of the hydrocarbon chain is converted to \nthe \n COOH group, forming a carboxylic acid (see page \n237). For example:\n231\nCH3CH2CN + HCl + 2H2O \n CH3CH2COOH + NH4Cl\n\t propanenitrile\t\npropanoic acid\nReacting as acids\nCarboxylic acids are described as weak acids because \ntheir molecules do not dissociate (ionise) completely \nwhen added to water. However a small proportion of the \nmolecules do dissociate, releasing the H+(aq) ions that \ncharacterise all acidic solutions with a pH value less than 7. \nFor example, ethanoic acid forms aqueous hydrogen ions \nand ethanoate ions in water:\nCH3COOH(aq) \n CH3COO–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\nethanoic acid\t\nethanoate ion\nYou can learn more about the dissociation of carboxylic \nacids in Chapter 26 (pages 394–5).\nThe presence of H+(aq) ions in solutions of carboxylic \nacids means that they undergo all the usual reactions of \nacids. They react with\n■\n■\nalkalis to form a salt and water:\nCH3COOH  +  NaOH \n CH3COONa  +  H2O\n■\n■\nreactive metals to form a salt and hydrogen gas:\n2CH3COOH  +  Mg \n (CH3COO)2Mg  +  H2",

You can see that \nabsorption bands overlap considerably. That is why we \nneed to use a variety of techniques, such as NMR, infra-\nred spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, to work out the \nstructure of a new organic compound (see Chapter 29).\nAs well as their wavenumber bands, particular \nabsorbances have characteristic widths (broad or sharp \npeaks) and intensities (strong or weak) on the infra-red \nspectrum. For example, the presence of hydrogen bonding \nmakes the absorbance of the O     H bonds in alcohols \nand carboxylic acids broad. By contrast, the C     O bond \nin carbonyl groups has a strong, sharp absorbance peak. \nLook at the infra-red spectra of ethanol, ethanoic acid and \nethyl ethanoate shown in Figures 18.8–18.10.\nUsing the data in Table 18.3, note the broad bands \nin Figures 18.8 and 18.9 arising from the O     H groups \ninvolved in hydrogen bonding in the alcohol and in the \n0\n20\nAbsorbance / %\n40\n60\n242\n80\n100\n4000\n3500\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\nWavenumber / cm–1\nFigure 18.8  The infra-red spectrum of ethanol, CH3CH2OH.\nQuestion\n7\t \u0007Look at the two infra-red spectra below:\nA\nB\n0\n20\nAbsorbance / %\n40\n60\n80\n100\n4000\n3500\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\nWavenumber / cm–1\n\u0007a\t \u0007Which one of the infra-red spectra is that of butanone and which one is of butan-2-ol?\n\n---\n\ncarboxylic acid.

Ketones are not oxidised under \nmild conditions. \n■ The polar nature of the carbonyl group in aldehydes \nand ketones enables them to undergo nucleophilic \naddition by reacting with the cyanide ions (CN–) from \nHCN.

          "content": "Review of practical knowledge \nand understanding\nIn scientific investigations we are often interested in \nfinding out how one variable affects another. For example, \nwe might want to investigate a precipitation reaction \nto find out how the concentration of a reactant affects \nthe rate at which the precipitate forms. You might have \nseen the reaction between sodium thiosulfate and dilute \nhydrochloric acid, which is a commonly investigated \nprecipitation reaction. Sulfur is the precipitate formed:\nNa2S2O3(aq)  +  2HCl(aq) \n 2NaCl(aq)  +  S(s)  +  H2O(l)  +  SO2(g)\nThis type of investigation involves changing only the \nvariable under investigation (in this case the concentration \nof a reactant) and keeping all other relevant variables \nconstant. We can judge the effect of changing the \nconcentration by devising a way to measure how quickly \nthe precipitate forms, such as timing how long it takes for \nthe solution to become opaque.\nWe now have the question we are investigating and the \nstructure of the investigation in terms of its key variables:\nIn a precipitation reaction, how does the concentration of \na reactant affect the rate of precipitation (as measured by \nthe time it takes for the solution to become opaque)?\n\n---\n\nFigure P1.1  Chemist performing a titration.\n■\n■\nThe independent variable is the one under investigation, \nwhich is changed systematically and for which we can \nchoose different values (in this case, the concentration \nof reactant).\n■\n■\nThe dependent variable is the one we measure to judge the \neffect of changing the independent variable (in this case, \nthe time it takes for the solution to become opaque).\n247\n■\n■\nThe control variables are those that we must keep \nconstant to ensure a fair test is carried out (in this case, \nwe should control the temperature and total volume of \nreactants used).\nNote that we can express the question in this type of \ninvestigation generally as:\nHow does the independent variable affect the dependent \nvariable?\nWhen asked to plan and/or carry out an investigation, it is \nimportant that you state the question under investigation \nclearly and list the independent, dependent and control \nvariables before you start writing down your proposed \nmethod or planning how to record and present your results.\nThe type of variable under investigation will determine \nwhether you display the data collected in a table as a line \ngraph or as a bar chart. To decide which type of graph \nto draw, you need to know the difference between \ncontinuous variables – which are measured so can have any \nnumerical value within the range of results – and categoric\n\nvariables – which are described by words. We can assume \nthat the dependent variable is continuous, as it measures \nthe effect of varying the independent variable. Then if the \nindependent variable is continuous, we draw a line graph. \nIf the independent variable is categoric, we draw a bar \nchart. So if you investigate the effect of temperature on \nrate of reaction, the data can be presented as a line graph, \nwhereas if you investigate the rate of different metals \nreacting with dilute acid, the data can be presented as a bar \nchart (as there are no values between those chosen for the \nindependent variable). See the graphs in Figure P1.2.\nIn the Cambridge International AS and A Level \nAdvanced Practical Skills examination (Paper 3), you will \nneed to follow instructions to carry out an investigation \ninto an unknown substance or mixture of substances. \nAlways read through all of the instructions before carrying \nout the tests. Testing for unknown substances will require \nyou to describe your observations in detail. You will be able \nto refer to tables of tests for cations, anions and gases in the \nQualitative Analysis Notes in your examination paper (see \nAppendix 3, page 475) to draw your conclusions.\nYou will also carry out a quantitative task (based on \nmeasurements) rather than a qualitative task (based on \nobservations). Examples of problems that need you to \ncollect quantitative data could be a titration (a volumetric \nanalysis) or an enthalpy change experiment. This type \nof task will require you to read scales on measuring \ninstruments such as burettes, measuring cylinders, gas \nsyringes and balances. For instruments with an analogue \nscale, such as a burette, you should be able to read \nmeasurements to within half the value of the fine line \ndivisions on the scale. So a burette with fine line divisions \nevery 0.10 cm3 should be read to the nearest 0.05 cm3.

Generally, the independent variable goes in the first \ncolumn and the dependent variable goes in the second \ncolumn.

In this case, the independent \nvariable again goes first but at the start of the first row in \nthe table, with the dependent variable beneath it, not next \nto it as in a conventional table.\n■\n■\nWhen recording quantitative data you will often need \ncolumns for repeat results and calculations of the mean. This \nis achieved by subdividing the column for the dependent \nvariable into the required number of columns. For example, \nin the rate of precipitation investigation described at the \nbeginning of this chapter, the table to record three repeat \nreadings and their means would be organised as:\nConcentration / \nmol dm–3\nTime for reaction mixture to turn \nopaque / s\n1st test\n2nd test\n3rd test\nMean\n■\n■\nNote that the headings in the table have their units included \n– therefore you do not need to record the units for each \nentry you make in the table.\n■\n■\nOn graphs, always plot the independent variable along \nthe horizontal (x) axis and the dependent variable up the \nvertical (y) axis.\n\n■\n■\nDraw the lines in tables and graphs in pencil, labelling the \naxes as in the corresponding table headings with their units.\n■\n■\nIn the table above, there could be an extra column on the \nright-hand side for values of the reciprocal of the mean \ntime taken for the reaction mixture to become opaque \n(headed ‘1 / time’). This could be plotted on a graph of \n1/time against concentration to see how the rate of reaction \nvaries with temperature (as rate is proportional to 1/time, \nso the greater the time, the slower the rate). See the graphs \nin Figure P1.4.\n■\n■\nThe labelled axes must be longer than half the size of the \ngraph grid in both directions, selecting a sensible scale (e.g. \n1, 2 or 5 units per 20 mm square on the grid – not 3 units).\n■\n■\nThe points should be plotted as small, neat x’s with a sharp \npencil. The line drawn through the points should not be \n‘dot-to-dot’ but should be a line of best fit – either drawn \nwith a ruler for a straight line or a smooth free-hand line for \na curve.

          "content": "Factors affecting the value of \nlattice energy\nLattice energy arises from the electrostatic force of \nattraction of oppositely charged ions when the crystalline \nlattice is formed. The size and charge of these ions can \naffect the value of the lattice energy.\nLattice energy and ion size\nAs the size of the ion increases, the lattice energy becomes \nless exothermic. This applies to both anions and cations. \nFigure 19.6 shows that:\n■\n■\nfor any given anion, e.g. F –, the lattice energy gets less \nexothermic as the size of the cation increases from Li+ to Cs+\n■\n■\nfor any given cation, e.g. Li+, the lattice energy gets less \nexothermic as the size of the anion increases from F– to I–.\n–1100\nLi+\n–1000\nLattice enthalpy/ kJmol–1\nNa+\n–900\nRb+\nK+\n–800\nCs+\n–700\n–600\nCl–\nBr–\nI–\nF–\n0\n.\n\nIons with the same ionic charge have a lower charge density \nif their radius is larger. This is because the same charge is \nspread out over a larger volume. A lower charge density \nresults in weaker electrostatic forces of attraction in the \nionic lattice. Sodium fluoride has a less exothermic lattice \nenergy than lithium fluoride. This reflects the lower charge \ndensity on sodium ions compared with lithium ions.\nLattice energy and charge on the ions\nThe lattice energy becomes more exothermic as the ionic \ncharge increases.\nWe can see this by comparing lithium fluoride, LiF, \nwith magnesium oxide, MgO. These compounds have the \nsame arrangement of ions in their lattice structure. The \ncations Li+ and Mg2+ have similar sizes. The anions F – \nand O2– are fairly similar in size (although they are much \nlarger than the cations). The major physical difference \nbetween LiF and MgO is the ionic charge. This affects the \nlattice energy:\nΔH \nO\n—\nlatt [LiF] = –1049 kJ mol–1\nΔH \nO\n—\nlatt [MgO] = –3923 kJ mol–1\nMagnesium oxide has a greater lattice energy than \nlithium fluoride. The doubly charged Mg2+ and O2– ions \nin magnesium oxide attract each other more strongly \nthan the singly charged ions of the same size in LiF. \nFor ions of similar size, the greater the ionic charge, the \nhigher the charge density. This results in stronger ionic \nbonds being formed.\nquestions\n8\t a\t \u0007For each pair of compounds, suggest which will have \nthe most exothermic lattice energy.\ni\t\nKCl and BaO (ionic radii are similar)\nii\t MgI2 and SrI2\niii\t CaO and NaCl (ionic radii are similar).\nb\t \u0007Place the following compounds in order of \nincreasingly exothermic lattice energy.

Use this relationship to explain why:\na\t \u0007magnesium oxide has a greater lattice energy than \nlithium fluoride\nb\t \u0007lithium fluoride has a greater lattice energy than \npotassium bromide.\nIon polarisation\nIn our model of an ionic lattice, we have thought of the \nions as being spherical in shape. This is not always the \ncase. In some cases, the positive charge on the cation in an \nionic lattice may attract the electrons in the anion towards \nit. This results in a distortion of the electron cloud of the \nanion and the anion is no longer spherical (Figure 19.7). \nWe call this distortion ion polarisation.

These \nbonds are called ion–dipole bonds. Water is a polar \nmolecule. The δ– oxygen atoms in water molecules are \nattracted to the positive ions in the ionic compound.

          "content": "Electrode potentials\nIntroducing electrode potentials\nA redox equilibrium exists between two chemically related \nspecies that are in different oxidation states. For example, \nwhen a copper rod is placed in contact with an aqueous \nsolution of its ions the following equilibrium exists:\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e– \n Cu(s)\nThere are two opposing reactions in this equilibrium.\n■\n■\nMetal atoms from the rod entering the solution as metal \nions. This leaves electrons behind on the surface of the rod. \nFor example:\nCu(s) \n Cu2+(aq)  +  2e–\n■\n■\nIons in solution accepting electrons from the metal rod and \nbeing deposited as metal atoms on the surface of the rod. \nFor example:\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e– \n Cu(s)\nThe redox equilibrium is established when the rate of \nelectron gain equals the rate of electron loss.\nFor unreactive metals such as copper, if this \nequilibrium is compared with the equilibrium set up by \nother metals, the equilibrium set up by copper lies further \nover to the right.\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e– \n Cu(s)\nCu2+(aq) ions are therefore relatively easy to reduce. They \ngain electrons readily to form copper metal.\n\nFor reactive metals such as vanadium, the equilibrium \nlies further over to the left.\nV2+(aq)  +  2e– \n V(s)\nV2+(aq) ions are therefore relatively difficult to reduce. \nThey gain electrons much less readily by comparison.\nThe position of equilibrium differs for different \ncombinations of metals placed in solutions of their ions.\nWhen a metal is put into a solution of its ions an electric \npotential (voltage) is established between the metal and the \nmetal ions in solution. We cannot measure this potential \ndirectly. But we can measure the difference in potential \nbetween the metal/metal ion system and another system. We \ncall this value the electrode potential, E. Electrode potential \nis measured in volts. The system we use for comparison is the \nstandard hydrogen electrode.\nIt is thought that the absolute electrical potentials \nthat we cannot measure are caused by the formation of \nan electrical double layer when an element is placed in a \nsolution of its ions. For example, when zinc is placed in a \nsolution containing zinc ions, a tiny number of zinc atoms \non the surface of the metal are converted to zinc ions, \nwhich go into solution. This leaves an excess of electrons \non the surface of the zinc. The solution around the metal \nnow has excess Zn2+ ions. Some of these cations near \nthe surface of the zinc are attracted to its surface. So an \nelectrical double layer is formed. This build up of charge \ncauses an electric potential (voltage) between the metal \nand the metal ions in solution (Figure 20.4).\n2+ = Zn2+ ions\nzinc rod\nZnSO4(aq)\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\n2+\nFigure 20.4  The separation of charge when a zinc rod is \nplaced in a solution of Zn2+ ions results in an electrical \ndouble layer.\n\n---\n\nThe standard hydrogen electrode\nThe standard hydrogen electrode is one of several \ntypes of half-cell that can be used as reference \nelectrodes.

The \nplatinum electrode is inert so it does not take part \nin the reaction.\nStandard electrode potential E O\n— values for all \nhalf-cells are measured relative to this electrode. \nWhen connected to another half-cell, the value \nread on the voltmeter gives the standard electrode \npotential for that half-cell.\nThe half-equation for the hydrogen electrode can \nbe written:\n2H+(aq)  +  2e– \n H2(g)\nor\nH+(aq)  +  e– \n ​ 1 _ \n2 ​ H2(g)\n\nElectrode potential and redox reactions\nElectrode potential values give us an indication of how \neasy it is to reduce a substance.\nNote that:\n■\n■\nBy convention, the electrode potential refers to the \nreduction reaction. So the electrons appear on the left-hand \nside of the half-equation. For example:\nAl3+(aq)  +  3e– \n Al(s)\n■\n■\nThe more positive (or less negative) the electrode potential, \nthe easier it is to reduce the ions on the left. So the metal \non the right is relatively unreactive and is a relatively poor \nreducing agent. For example:\nAg+(aq)  +  e– \n Ag(s)\b\nvoltage = +0.80 V\n■\n■\nThe more negative (or less positive) the electrode potential, \nthe more difficult it is to reduce the ions on the left. So the \nmetal on the right is relatively reactive and is a relatively \ngood reducing agent.

We can measure the voltage \nbetween these two half-cells. Figure 20.7 shows a \nCu2+/Cu half-cell connected to a Zn2+/Zn half-cell to \nmake a complete electrochemical cell.\nHalf-cells are connected together using:\n■\n■\nwires connecting the metal rods in each half-cell \nto a high-resistance voltmeter; the electrons flow \nround this external circuit from the metal with the \nmore negative (or less positive) electrode potential \nto the metal with the less negative (or more positive) \nelectrode potential\n■\n■\na salt bridge to complete the electrical circuit allowing \nthe movement of ions between the two half-cells so \nthat ionic balance is maintained; a salt bridge does not \nallow the movement of electrons.\nA salt bridge can be made from a strip of filter \npaper (or other inert porous material) soaked in a \nsaturated solution of potassium nitrate.\n\nCombining half-cells (continued)\nThe voltages for the half-cells in Figure 20.7 can be \nrepresented by the following half-equations:\nCu2+(aq)  +  2e– \n Cu(s)\t\nvoltage = +0.34 V\nZn2+(aq)  +  2e– \n Zn(s)\t\nvoltage = –0.76 V\nThe relative values of these voltages tell us that \nZn2+ ions are more difficult to reduce than Cu2+ ions. \nSo Cu2+ ions will accept electrons from the Zn2+/Zn \nhalf-cell and zinc will lose electrons to the Cu2+/Cu \nhalf-cell.\nHalf-equations can be used to show us the contents \nof half-cells. A half-cell does not have to be a \nmetal/metal ion system. We can construct half-cells \nfor any half-equation written.

So the value of E becomes more positive / \nless negative.\nIf two different ions are present in the half-cell, we have \nto consider both ions.\nLet us take the equilibrium between Fe3+ ions and Fe2+ \nions as an example.\n\n■\n■\nIf [Fe3+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm –3 \n(keeping [Fe2+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes \nmore positive (for example +0.85 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Fe3+] is less than 1.00 mol dm–3 \n(keeping [Fe2+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes less \npositive (for example +0.70 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Fe2+] is greater than 1.00 mol dm–3 \n(keeping [Fe3+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes less \npositive (for example +0.70 V).\n■\n■\nIf [Fe2+] is less than 1.00 mol dm–3 \n(keeping [Fe3+] = 1.00 mol dm–3) the value of E becomes \nmore positive (for example +0.85 V).\nYou can see from the above that if we increase the \nconcentration of both the Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions, these effects \nmay cancel each other out.\nHow can we predict whether or not a given reaction \nwill occur under non-standard conditions? The answer \nis that if the E \nO\n—\n values of the two half-reactions involved \ndiffer by more than 0.30 V, then the reaction predicted by \nthe E \nO\n—\n values is highly likely to occur. So chlorine is likely \nto oxidise Fe2+ ions even if the conditions are not standard. \nThis is because the difference in their E \nO\n—\n values is 0.59 V, \nwhich is considerably greater than 0.30 V.\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2(g)  +  e– \n Cl– (aq)\b\nE \nO\n—\n = +1.36 V\nFe3+(aq)  +  e– \n Fe2+(aq)\b\nE \nO\n—\n = +0.77 V\nWe cannot, however, predict with confidence whether the \nreaction between MnO4\n– ions and Cl2 will take place if the \nconditions are too far from standard.\nMnO4\n–(aq)  +  8H+(aq)  +  5e– \n Mn2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nE \nO\n—\n = +1.52 V\n​ 1 _ \n2 ​ Cl2(g)  +  e– \n Cl–(aq)\b\nE \nO\n—\n = +1.36 V\nThis is because the difference in E \nO\n—\n values is 0.16 V, which \nis considerably smaller than 0.30 V.\nThe figure 0.30 V given here to enable us to tell if a \nreaction will still occur under non-standard conditions is a \nrough guide only. If E \nO\n—\n values differ by less than 0.30 V, non-\nstandard conditions may result in an unexpected outcome.\n\n---\n\nQuestion\n26\t The half-cell\nCr2O7\n2–  +  14H+  +  6e– \n 2Cr3+  +  7H2O\nhas an E O\n—\n value of +1.33 V.\na\t \u0007Suggest how the value of E O\n—\n changes if the other \nspecies are kept at 1.00 mol dm–3 but:\ni\t\n[Cr2O7\n2–] is increased\nii\t [H+] is decreased\niii\t [Cr3+] is increased.\nb\t \u0007What effect would each of these concentration \nchanges have on the strength of the acidified \nCr2O7\n2– solution as an oxidising agent?\nc\t\n\u0007What conditions would you use to make a solution \nof Cr2O7\n2– as strong an oxidising agent as possible?\nd\t \u0007Use Le Chatelier’s principle to explain your answer \nto part c.\n\u0007\nThe Nernst equation\nIf we consider a cell made up from a silver/silver ion \nelectrode and a copper/copper(II) ion electrode, the \nreaction taking place is:\n291\nCu(s)  +  2Ag+(aq) \n Cu2+(aq)  +  2Ag(s)\b E \nO\n—\n = +0.46 V\nstandard conditions and change the concentration of the \nsilver ions, we obtain the graph shown in Figure 20.23. \nNote that we have plotted the value of Ecell (non-standard \nconditions for the cell as a whole) against the logarithm of \nthe silver ion concentration.\n0.5\n0.46 V\nE O\n—\ncell \n0.4\n0.3\nEcell / V\n0.2\n0.1\nlg [Ag+]\n–7\n–8\n0\n–6\n–5\n–4\n–3\n–2\n–1\n0\nFigure 20.23  Increasing the concentration of silver ions in the \ncell reaction Cu(s)  +  2Ag+(aq) \n Cu2+(aq)  +  2Ag(s) makes \nthe value of Ecell more positive.\n\nThe effect of concentration and temperature on the value of \nEcell can be deduced using the Nernst equation.

Several of \nthese cells are often needed to produce enough power \nand the voltage of these ‘batteries’ drops gradually during \ntheir lifetime.\nA wide variety of electrochemical cells have been \ndeveloped for specific functions in recent years. Many cells \nare small but they do not necessarily produce a high voltage \nfor a long time. Batteries of several cells joined together give \na higher voltage but take up more space.

In these cells the redox reactions \ncontinue until the reactants reach a low concentration and \nthe voltage of the cell declines. The cell is then no longer \nof any use. Some electrochemical cells can be recharged \nby passing an electric current through them. The products \nare then changed back to reactants so the cell can function \nagain. These cells are called secondary cells or storage cells.\nA car battery is a secondary cell that consists of plates \nof lead and lead(IV) oxide immersed in sulfuric acid \n(Figure 20.24).

          "content": "Buffer solutions\nWhat is a buffer solution?\nA buffer solution is a solution in which the pH does not \nchange significantly when small amounts of acids or \nalkalis are added. A buffer solution is used to keep pH \n(almost) constant.\nOne type of buffer solution is a mixture of a weak acid \nand one of its salts. An example is an aqueous mixture of \nethanoic acid and sodium ethanoate. Mixtures of ethanoic \nacid and sodium ethanoate in different proportions act as \nbuffers between pH values of 4 and 7. We can understand \nhow a buffer solution works by referring to the equilibria \ninvolved.\nEthanoic acid is a weak acid. So it stays mostly in the \nun-ionised form (CH3COOH) and only gives rise to a low \nconcentration of ethanoate ions in solution:\nCH3COOH(aq) \n H+(aq)  +  CH3COO–(aq)\nethanoic acid\t\nethanoate ion\n\n---\n\nFigure 21.12  The pH of this agar plate for growing bacteria is \nkept constant by using a buffer solution.

We say that there are \nreserve supplies of the acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate \nbase (CH3COO–). The pH of a buffer solution depends \non the ratio of the concentration of the acid and the \nconcentration of its conjugate base. If this does not change \nvery much, the pH changes very little.\nIn the buffer solution ethanoic acid molecules are in \nequilibrium with hydrogen ions and ethanoate ions:\n313\nCH3COOH(aq) \n H+(aq)  +  CH3COO–(aq)\nrelatively high\t\nrelatively high \nconcentration\t\nconcentration \nof ethanoic acid\t\nof ethanoate ions\nWe can use this equation to explain how buffer \nsolutions work.\nAn increase in hydrogen ion concentration would \ngreatly lower the pH of water, but when H+ ions are added \nto the buffer solution:\n■\n■\naddition of H+ ions shifts the position of equilibrium to the \nleft because H+ ions combine with CH3COO– ions to form more \nCH3COOH until equilibrium is re-established\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COO– ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COO– ions in solution does not \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COOH ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COOH molecules in solution does not \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nso the pH does not change significantly.\n\nAn increase in hydroxide ion concentration would greatly \nincrease the pH of water, but when OH– ions are added to \nthe buffer solution:\n■\n■\nthe added OH– ions combine with H+ ions to form water\n■\n■\nthis reduces the H+ ion concentration\n■\n■\nthe position of equilibrium shifts to the right\n■\n■\nso CH3COOH molecules ionise to form more H+ and \nCH3COO– ions until equilibrium is re-established\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COOH ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COOH molecules in solution does not \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nthe large reserve supply of CH3COO– ensures that the \nconcentration of CH3COO– ions in solution does not \nchange significantly\n■\n■\nso the pH does not change significantly.\nIn unpolluted regions of the Earth, rainwater has a pH \nof 5.7. This is because carbon dioxide dissolves in the \nrainwater to form a dilute solution of the weak acid \ncarbonic acid, H2CO3. This acid and its conjugate base, \nHCO3\n–, act as a buffer solution. It minimises changes in \npH if very small amounts of acid or alkali are added to the \nrainwater. But in regions where there is pollution caused \nby the emission of acidic oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, the \npH of the rainwater falls to around 4. The rainwater can \nno longer act as a buffer because the concentrations of the \nH2CO3 and HCO3\n– are not high enough to cope with the \nlarge amounts of acidic pollution involved.\nNo buffer solution can cope with the excessive addition \nof acids or alkalis. If very large amounts of acid or alkali \nare added, the pH will change significantly.\nBuffer solutions that resist changes in pH in alkaline \nregions are usually a mixture of a weak base and its \nconjugate acid. An example is a mixture of aqueous \nammonia with ammonium chloride.\nAqueous ammonia is a weak base, so there is only a low \nconcentration of ammonium ions in ammonia solution:\n314\nNH3(aq)  +  H2O(l) \n NH4\n+(aq)  +  OH–(aq)\nAmmonium chloride is fully ionised in aqueous \nsolution.

They are also used to \nmake sure that pH meters record the correct pH.\nMany animals depend on buffers to keep a constant \npH in various parts of their bodies. In humans, the pH \nof the blood is kept between 7.35 and 7.45 by a number of \ndifferent buffers in the blood:\n■\n■\nhydrogencarbonate ions, HCO3\n–\n■\n■\nhaemoglobin and plasma proteins\n■\n■\ndihydrogenphosphate (H2PO4\n–) and hydrogenphosphate \n(HPO4\n2–) ions.\nThe cells in our body produce carbon dioxide as a product \nof aerobic respiration (the oxidation of glucose to provide \nenergy).

When the blood passes through the small \nblood vessels around our lungs hydrogencarbonate ions \nare rapidly converted to carbon dioxide and water. The \ncarbon dioxide escapes into the lungs.\nThe production of H+ ions, if left unchecked, would lower \nthe pH of the blood and cause ‘acidosis’. This may disrupt \nsome body functions and eventually lead to coma. The \nequilibrium between carbon dioxide and hydrogencarbonate \nis the most important buffering system in the blood.\nIf the H+ ion concentration increases:\n■\n■\nthe position of this equilibrium shifts to the left\n■\n■\nH+ ions combine with HCO3\n– ions to form carbon dioxide \nand water until equilibrium is restored\n■\n■\nthis reduces the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood \nand helps keep the pH constant.\nIf the H+ ion concentration decreases:\n■\n■\nthe position of this equilibrium shifts to the right\n■\n■\nsome carbon dioxide and water combine to form H+ and \nHCO3\n– ions until equilibrium is restored",

The ions move from the solid to the saturated \nsolution at the same rate as they move from the solution to \nthe solid (Figure 21.14).\n–\n–\n–\n–\n+\n+\n+\n+\nAgCl(aq)\nAg+\n–\n–\n+\n+\n–\n–\nCl–\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nAgCl(s)\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n\n---\n\nWhen solid silver chloride dissolves it is in contact with \nsaturated silver chloride solution and the following \nequilibrium is set up:\nAgCl(s) \n Ag+(aq)  +  Cl–(aq)\nThe equilibrium expression relating to this equation is:\nKc = ​ [Ag+(aq)] [Cl–(aq)] \n________________ \n[AgCl(s)] \n​\nFor any solid, the concentration of the solid phase remains \nconstant and can be combined with the value of Kc.\nSo we can write this equilibrium expression as:\nKsp = [Ag+(aq)] [Cl–(aq)]\nKsp is called the solubility product. Values are quoted \nat 298 K.\nSolubility product is the product of the concentrations \nof each ion in a saturated solution of a sparingly soluble \nsalt at 298 K, raised to the power of their relative \nconcentrations.\nKsp = [Cy+(aq)]a[Ax–(aq)]b\nwhere a is the number of C y+ cations in one formula unit \nof the compound and b is the number of Ax– anions in one \nformula unit of the compound\nSo for Fe2S3 (which contains Fe3+ ions and S2– ions) the \nequilibrium is:\nFe2S3(s) \n 2Fe3+(aq)  +  3S2–(aq)\nand the equilibrium expression is:\nKsp = [Fe3+(aq)]2[S2–(aq)]3\nThe idea of solubility product only applies to ionic \ncompounds that are only slightly soluble.\nThe units of solubility product depend on the number \nof each type of ion present in solution. You can work \nthe units out in the same way as for general equilibrium \nexpressions (see page 123), but you don’t have to do any \ncancelling. For example, for the expression:\nKsp\t=\t[Mg2+(aq)] × [OH–(aq)]2\n=\tmol dm–3 × (mol dm–3)2\n=\tmol3 dm–9\n\nThe idea of solubility product is only useful for sparingly \nsoluble salts. The smaller the value of Ksp the lower is the \nsolubility of the salt.

An example \nis the alkaline hydrolysis of bromobutane:\nC4H9Br  +  OH– \n C4H9OH  +  Br –\nSamples are removed at various times and \n‘quenched’ to stop or slow down the reaction, \ne.g. by cooling the sample in ice. The hydroxide \nion concentration can be found by titration with a \nstandard solution of a strong acid.\n2  Continuous\nIn this method a physical property of the reaction \nmixture is monitored over a period of time. Some \nexamples are using colorimetry, a conductivity meter \nor measuring changes in gas volume or gas pressure.\nColorimetry can be used to monitor the change in \ncolour of a particular reactant. For example, this \nmethod can be used to follow the reaction of iodine \nwith propanone:\n326\nCH3COCH3  +  I2 \n CH3COCH2I  +  HI\nAs the reaction proceeds, the colour of the iodine \nfades.\nChanges in electrical conductivity of the solution can \nbe measured. For example, this method can be used \nto follow the reaction:\n(CH3)3CBr  +  H2O \n (CH3)3COH  +  H+  +  Br –\nAs the reaction proceeds, the electrical conductivity \nof the solution increases because ions are being \nformed in the reaction. This method can sometimes \nbe used even if there are ions on both sides of the \nequation. This is due to the fact that ions vary in their \nconductivities. For example the small H+ and OH– \nions have very high conductivities but Br – ions have a \nlow conductivity.\nChanges in gas volume or gas pressure can be \nmeasured. For example, this method can be used to \nfollow the reaction of benzenediazonium chloride, \nC6H5N   N+Cl–, with water.\nC6H5N   N+Cl–(aq)  +  H2O(l) \n C6H5OH(aq)  +  N2(g)  +  HCl(aq)\n\n---\n\nFigure 22.2  A colorimeter can be used to monitor the \nprogress of a reaction. It measures the transmission of \nlight through a ‘cell’ containing the reaction mixture. The \nless concentrated the colour of the reaction mixture, the \nmore light is transmitted through the ‘cell’.\nThe reaction can be monitored by measuring the \nchange in volume of gas released with time. You \nmay have used this method to follow the rate \nof the reaction between calcium carbonate and \nhydrochloric acid. If you did, you will have measured \nthe change in volume of carbon dioxide gas released \nwith time.\nFigure 22.3  Rate of reaction can be followed by \nmeasuring the change in volume of a gas given off in a \nreaction. in this experiment CO2 is being given off when \nCaCO3 reacts with HCl.\n\nMethods for following the course of a reaction (continued)\nThe progress of some reactions can be followed \nby measuring small changes in the volume of the \nreaction mixture. For example, during the hydration \nof methylpropene, the volume decreases.\nH+\n(CH3)2C   CH2  +  H2O \n (CH3)3COH\nAn instrument called a dilatometer (Figure 22.4) is \nused to measure the small changes in volume. The \ntemperature has to be controlled to an accuracy of \n±0.001 °C. Can you think why?\nQuestion\n2\t a\t \u0007Suggest a suitable method for following the \nprogress of each of these reactions:\ni\t\nH2O2(aq)  +  2I–(aq)  +  2H+(aq) \n 2H2O(l)  +  I2(aq)\nii\t HCOOCH3(aq)  +  H2O(l) \n HCOOH(aq)  +  CH3OH(aq)\niii\t 2H2O2(aq) \n 2H2O(l)  +  O2(g)\niv\t BrO3\n–(aq)  +  5Br –(aq)  +  6H+(aq)\n 3Br2(aq)  +  3H2O(l)\nb\t \u0007Why is it essential that the temperature is \nkept constant when measuring the progress of \na reaction?\nCalculating rate of reaction graphically\nRate of reaction usually changes as the reaction proceeds. \nThis is because the concentration of reactants is \ndecreasing.

In Chapter 6 (page 91) we used the symbol Δ \n(Greek capital ‘delta’) to represent a change in a particular \nquantity.

You will notice, however, that the graph is a curve \nwhich becomes shallower with time. So the rate decreases \nwith time. By measuring the change in concentration over \nshorter and shorter time intervals we get an increasingly \naccurate value of the reaction rate. If we make the time \ninterval over which we measure the reaction almost zero, \nwe obtain a reaction rate at a particular instant. We do this \nby drawing tangents at particular points on the curve. \nLine B in Figure 22.5b shows a tangent drawn at the start \nof the curve. This gives a much more accurate value of the \ninitial rate of reaction.\nFigure 22.6 shows how to draw a tangent and \ncalculate the rate at a particular point on a curve. In \nthis case, we are using a graph of concentration of \ncyclopropane against time.\nThe procedure is:\n■\n■\nSelect a point on the graph corresponding to a particular \ntime (10 minutes in this example).\n■\n■\nDraw a straight line at this point so that it just touches the \nline.

          "content": "Rate equations\nThe rate constant and rate equations\nThe third column in Table 22.2 shows that the rate of the \nreaction is proportional to cyclopropane concentration \n(within the limits of experimental error). We can express \nthis mathematically as:\nrate of reaction = k × [cyclopropane]\nThe proportionality constant, k, is called the rate constant.\nThe overall expression (rate of reaction = k × [cyclopropane]) \nis the rate equation for this particular reaction. Rate \nequations are generally written without the × sign. \nFor example:\nrate = k[cyclopropane]\nRate equations can only be determined from experimental \ndata. They cannot be found from the stoichiometric \nequation.\nSome experimentally determined rate equations are \nshown in Table 22.3.\nYou can see from equation 1 that the rate of reaction \nis proportional to the concentration of both H2 and I2; \nhowever, in equation 2, CO and O2 do not appear in \nthe rate equation, even though they are present in the \nstoichiometric equation. Similarly in reactions 3 and 4 \nthere is no relationship between the rate equation and the \nstoichiometry of the chemical equation.\n330\nStoichiometric equation\nRate equation\n1  H2(g)  +  I2(g) \n 2HI(g)\nrate = k[H2] [I2]\n NO2(g)  +  CO2(g)\nrate = k[NO]2\n2  NO(g)  +  CO(g)  +  O2(g)\n 2H2O(g)  +  N2(g) \nrate = k[H2] [NO]2\n3  2H2(g)  +  2NO(g) \n4  BrO3\n–(aq)  +  5Br–(aq)  +  H+(aq) \n 3Br2(aq)  +  3H2O(l)\nrate = k[BrO3\n–] [Br–] [H+]2\nTable 22.3  Rate equations for some reactions.\nIn order to find the rate equation we have to conduct a \nseries of experiments.

For equation 2\n\nin Table 22.3, the rate equation is rate = k[NO]2 and so the \norder is 2 with respect to [NO].\nWhen you are writing about order of reaction, you \nmust distinguish carefully between the order with respect \nto a particular reactant and the overall order of reaction. \nTaking equation 3 in Table 22.3 as an example:\nrate = k[H2] [NO]2\nWe say that this reaction is:\n■\n■\nfirst-order with respect to H2 \n(as rate is proportional to [H2]1)\n■\n■\nsecond-order with respect to NO \n(as rate is proportional to [NO]2)\n■\n■\nthird-order overall (as the sum of the powers is 1 + 2 = 3).\nIn general terms, for a reaction A  +  B \n products, the \nrate equation can be written in the form:\nrate of reaction = k[A]m[B]n\nIn this equation:\n■\n■\n[A] and [B] are the concentrations of the reactants\n■\n■\nm and n are the orders of the reaction\n■\n■\nthe values of m and n can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or rarely higher\n■\n■\nwhen the value of m or n is 0 we can ignore the \nconcentration term because any number to the power of \nzero = 1.\nOrders of reaction are not always whole numbers. A few \nreactions have fractional orders. For example, the reaction:\nCH3CHO(g) \n CH4(g)  +  CO(g)\nhas an overall order of 1.5.

          "content": "Kinetics and reaction \nmechanisms\nThe rate-determining step\nIn Worked example 5 you saw that for the reaction:\nH+\nCH3COCH3  +  I2 \n CH3COCH2I  +  HI\nthe iodine did not appear in the rate equation but the H+ \nions did.\n■\n■\nA reactant that appears in the chemical equation may have \nno affect on reaction rate.\n■\n■\nA substance that is not a reactant in the chemical equation \ncan affect reaction rate.\nIn organic chemistry, you have met the idea that reactions \noccur in a number of steps. We call this the reaction \nmechanism. These steps do not take place at the same \nrate. The overall rate of reaction depends on the slowest \nstep. We call this the rate-determining step. If the \nconcentration of a reactant appears in the rate equation, \nthen that reactant (or substances that react together \nto form it) appears in the rate-determining step. If a \nsubstance does not appear in the overall rate equation it \ndoes not take part in the rate-determining step. So, for \nthe reaction between propanone and iodine, H+ ions are \ninvolved in the rate-determining step but iodine is not.\nVerifying possible reaction mechanisms\nWe can use kinetic data to confirm proposed reaction \nmechanisms. It is important to realise that the mechanism is not \ndeduced from the kinetic data. The kinetic data simply show us \nthat a proposed reaction mechanism is possible.\nVarious mechanisms have been proposed for the \nreaction\nH+\nCH3COCH3  +  I2 \n CH3COCH2I  +  HI\nFigure 22.17 shows one proposed mechanism.\nThe rate equation for this reaction is\nrate = k[CH3COCH3] [H+]\nWe could not have deduced this reaction mechanism from \nthe rate equation. But the mechanism is consistent with \nthe rate equation.\nThe slow step (the rate-determining step) does not \ninvolve either propanone or hydrogen ions directly. \nHowever, the intermediate with the formula\n\nfast\nO\n+OH\nCH3 + H+\nCH3\nC\nCH3\nC\nCH3\n+OH\nOH\nslow\nC\n⎯⎯→\nC\n+ H +\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nCH2\n + I2\nC\nfast\nOH\n+OH\nC\nCH2I + I–\n⎯⎯→\nCH3\nCH3\nCH2\n+OH\nCH3\nfast\nO\nCH2I + I–\nC\nCH2I + HI\nC\nCH3\nFigure 22.17  Propanone molecules rapidly accept hydrogen \nions to form an intermediate that slowly forms propen-2-ol. \nThis reacts rapidly with iodine to give the products.\nis derived from substances that react together to form it \n(propanone and hydrogen ions). So both [CH3COCH3] \nand [H+] appear in the rate equation.\nThe reaction between iodine and the intermediate \nslow\n1\nslow\n1\nin the ﬁrst step – each molecule breaks down,\nthey don’t collide in pairs\nslow\nN2O5\nNO2 + NO3\n1\n(note that two molecules of N2O5 need to have \nreacted for subsequent steps to be completed)\nReaction steps:\nfast\nNO2 + NO3\nNO + NO2 + O2\n2\nfast\nNO + NO3\n2NO2\n3\nFigure 22.18  The rate equation tells us that the decomposition of individual molecules of nitrogen(V) oxide is the \nrate-determining step. The subsequent reactions are very much faster by comparison, and do not influence the overall rate. \nTry to match the reaction steps with the illustrations to get a picture of what is happening.\n\n---\n\nCH3C(OH)   CH2 is fast and iodine molecules are \nnot involved in the mechanism until after the rate-\ndetermining step. So the rate of reaction does not depend \non the concentration of iodine.\nOn page 337 we saw that the rate equation for the reaction\n2N2O5(g) \n 4NO2(g)  +  O2\nis rate = k[N2O5]. Figure 22.18 shows a suggested \nmechanism for this reaction. The rate equation \nsuggests that a single N2O5 molecule is involved in the \nrate-determining step. This fits in with the proposed \nmechanism that suggests that the decomposition of N2O5 \nto form NO2 and NO3 is the slow step. The steps that follow \nthe slow step are relatively fast and so have no effect on \nreaction rate.\nIf there is only a single species (atom, ion or molecule) \nin the rate-determining step we call the reaction \nunimolecular. If two species (which can be the same or \ndifferent) are involved in the rate-determining step, we say \nthat the reaction is bimolecular. Mechanisms that involve \na trimolecular step are rare. This is because it is unlikely \nthat three species will collide at the same time.\n339\nfast\n2\nfast\n+\n3\n\nQuestion\n14\t An acidified solution of hydrogen peroxide reacts with \niodide ions.\nH2O2(aq)  +  2H+(aq)  +  2I–(aq) \n 2H2O(l)  +  I2(aq)\nThe rate equation for this reaction is\nrate = [H2O2] [I–]\n\u0007The mechanism below has been proposed for this \nreaction.\nslow\nH2O2  +  I– \n H2O  +  IO–\nfast\nH+  +  IO– \n HIO\nfast\nHIO  +  H+  +  I– \n I2  +  H2O\nExplain why this mechanism is consistent with the rate \nequation.\nPredicting the order of a reaction from \nreaction mechanisms\nWe can predict the order of reaction from a given reaction \nmechanism if we know the intermediates present in the \nrate-determining step (or substances that react together to \nform the intermediate). Take, for example, the reaction of \npropanone with bromine in alkaline solution.\n340\nCH3COCH3 + Br2 + OH– \n CH3COCH2Br + H2O + Br–\nThe reaction mechanism is shown in Figure 22.19.\nH\nO\nH\nO\nH\nH\nslow\nC\nH + OH–\n+ H2O\n–\nC\nH\nC\nC\nH\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nO\nH\nH\nO\nH\nfast\n–\nH\nC\nC\n+ Br2\nC\nC\nC\nBr + Br –\nC\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nFigure 22.19  The reaction mechanism for the bromination of \npropanone in alkaline conditions.\nThe rate-determining step in this reaction is the slow step. \nThe slow step involves one molecule of propanone and one \nhydroxide ion, so only these two species appear in the rate \nequation. The reaction is second order overall, first order \nwith respect to propanone and first order with respect to \nhydroxide ions.\n\n---\n\nBromine does not appear in the rate equation, as it takes \npart in a fast step after the rate-determining step.\nCatalysis\nIn Chapter 9 (page 144) you saw that catalysts increase the \nrate of a chemical reaction.

This reaction is very slow.\nS2O8\n2–(aq)  +  2I–(aq) \n 2SO4\n2–(aq)  +  I2(aq)\nThe peroxodisulfate and iodide ions both have a negative \ncharge. In order to collide and react, these ions need \nconsiderable energy to overcome the repulsive forces when \nlike charges approach each other.\nFe3+(aq) ions catalyse this reaction. The catalysis \ninvolves two redox reactions.\n■\n■\nReaction 1: reduction of Fe3+ ions to Fe2+ ions by I– ions:\n2Fe3+(aq)  +  2I–(aq) \n 2Fe2+(aq)  +  I2(aq)\n■\n■\nReaction 2: oxidation of Fe2+ ions back to Fe3+ by S2O8\n2– ions:\n2Fe2+(aq)  +  S2O8\n2–(aq) \n 2Fe3+(aq)  +  2SO4\n2–(aq)\nIn both reactions 1 and 2, positively charged iron ions \nreact with negatively charged ions. As ions with unlike \ncharges are attracted to each other, these reactions are \nmore likely to occur than direct reaction between S2O8\n2– \nand I– ions.\nYou should notice that it doesn’t matter what the order \nis of the two reactions.

Note that the \ncatalysed reaction has two energy ‘humps’ because it is a \ntwo-stage reaction.\n\n---\n\nIn order for this catalysis to work, the standard electrode \npotentials for the reactions involving the catalyst must lie \nbetween the electrode potentials involving the two reactants \n(Figure 22.22).

The \nmechanism of this catalysis can be explained using the \ntheory of adsorption. Chemical adsorption (also called \nchemisorption) occurs when molecules become bonded to \natoms on the surface of a solid. Transition elements such as \nnickel are particularly good at chemisorbing hydrogen gas. \nFigure 22.23 shows the process of adsorption of hydrogen \nonto a nickel surface.\nYou must be careful to distinguish between the words \nadsorb and absorb. Adsorb means to bond to the surface \nof a substance. Absorb means to move right into the \nsubstance – rather like a sponge absorbs water.\nNi\natoms on \nnickel surface\nNi\nNi\nNi\nNi\nNi\nNi\nNi\nNi\nNi\nNi\nFigure 22.23  The adsorption of hydrogen onto a nickel surface.\n\n---\n\nThe stages in adsorption of hydrogen onto nickel are:\n■\n■\nhydrogen gas diffuses to the surface of the nickel\n■\n■\nthe hydrogen is physically adsorbed onto the surface – \nweak van der Waals’ forces link the hydrogen molecules to \nthe nickel\n■\n■\nthe hydrogen becomes chemically adsorbed onto the \nsurface – this causes stronger bonds to form between the \nhydrogen and the nickel\n■\n■\nthis causes weakening of the hydrogen–hydrogen \ncovalent bond.\nExamples of heterogeneous catalysis\nIron in the Haber process\nParticular conditions of temperature and pressure are \nrequired to form ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen \n(see page 182). The reaction is catalysed by iron. The \ncatalyst works by allowing hydrogen and nitrogen \nmolecules to come close together on the surface of the \niron. They are then more likely to react. Figure 22.24 \nshows the five steps in this heterogeneous catalysis.\n1\t Diffusion: nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas diffuse to the \nsurface of the iron.\n2\t Adsorption: the reactant molecules are chemically adsorbed \nonto the surface of the iron.

For the previous example:\noverall order is m + n\n■\t The order of reaction for a given reactant can be \ndetermined experimentally by either:\n–\t measuring the initial rate of reaction using \ndifferent concentrations of a given reactant while \nkeeping the concentrations of all other reactants \nfixed, or\n–\t determining the change in concentration of a \nspecific reactant as the experiment proceeds, \nthe rate being calculated from tangents taken at \nseveral points on the graph.\n\n■ The order of reaction can be determined from graphs \nof reaction rate against concentration.\n■ The half-life of a reaction is the time taken for the \nconcentration of a reactant to halve.\n■ In a first-order reaction the half-life is independent of \nthe concentration(s) of the reactant(s).\n■ The half-life of a first-order reaction may be used in \ncalculations to find the first-order rate constant using \nthe relationship \nt 1 _ \n2\n = 0.693 \n_____ \nk \n■ The rate-determining step is the slowest step in a \nreaction mechanism.

Entropy can also be thought of as a measure \nof the randomness or disorder of a system. Th e higher \nthe randomness or disorder, the greater the entropy of \nthe system. A system is the part under investigation. In \nchemistry this is the chemical reaction itself, i.e. reactants \nbeing converted to products. Th e system of magnesium \nreacting with sulfuric acid in a test tube to form magnesium \nsulfate and hydrogen releases energy to the surroundings. \nTh e surroundings include:\n350\n■\n■\nthe solvent (in this case water)\n■\n■\nthe air around the test tube\n■\n■\nthe test tube itself\n■\n■\nanything dipping into the test tube (e.g. a thermometer).\nChanges that tend to continue to happen naturally are \ncalled spontaneous changes. Once started, a spontaneous \nchange will carry on. When a light is applied, methane \ngas reacts with oxygen in a spontaneous reaction to form \ncarbon dioxide and water. Th e reaction is spontaneous \nbecause the methane continues to burn in the oxygen until \nAr atom\nbefore mixing\nHe atom\nincrease in entropy\n\n---\n\neither the methane or oxygen is completely used up. For \na reaction to be spontaneous, it does not need to happen \nrapidly. Many spontaneous reactions are slow or need an \ninput of energy to start them.\nEntropy can also be thought of as a dispersal of energy, \neither from the system to the surroundings or from \nthe surroundings to the system. Th e system becomes \nenergetically more stable when it becomes more disordered.\nChance and spontaneous change\nDiff usion\nIf you spill a few drops of perfume in a closed room with \nno air draughts, the smell spreads gradually throughout \nthe room.

Th e reason molecules in a vapour diff use \nis because of the laws of chance and probability.\nafter mixing\n\nWe can make a model to show how, during a \nspontaneous process, the entropy of the system increases. \nFigure 23.2 shows a system of two flasks connected by \na stopcock. One flask contains helium and the other \ncontains argon. These gases do not react.\nWhen the stopcock is opened, the gas atoms move \nspontaneously by diffusion. After mixing, the gases are \nmixed up and there is more disorder than before mixing. \nThe entropy has increased.\nDiffusion and number of ways\nWe can show that the molecules in a vapour diffuse by \nchance by thinking about the probability of finding them \nat one place at any one time. Consider the simplified \nmodel shown below.\npartition\n1\n3\n2\ngas jar A\ngas jar B\nThe three molecules in gas jar A cannot move into gas \njar B.\nIn this model we assume that:\n■\n■\nthere are only a few molecules in gas jar A\n■\n■\nthere are no other particles present\n■\n■\nthe molecules move randomly and change directions \nwhen they collide.\nAfter we remove the partition, the molecules can move \nrandomly not only within gas jar A but also into gas jar \nB. There are three molecules and two places in which they \ncan be (gas jar A and gas jar B). The number of ways of \narranging the molecules after removing the partition is \nshown in Figure 23.3.\n2\n1\n2\n1\n3\n3\n2\n2\n1\n1\n3\n3\n3\n1\n2\n2\n3\n1\n3\n2\n1\n3\n1\n2\nFigure 23.3  The eight possible arrangements of molecules \nafter removing the partition between the gas jars.\n\n---\n\nThere are eight different ways of arranging the three \nmolecules between two gas jars. We can express this as:\nnumber of molecules\n\t2 × 2 × 2 = 23 = 8\ntwo gas jars\nEach of these ways is equally likely (probable). So the \nchance that all the molecules will stay in gas jar A is 1 in \n8. Similarly, the chance that all three molecules will move \nover to gas jar B is 1 in 8. The molecules diffuse because \nthere are more ways of them being spread out than \nremaining in the same place.\nIf we started with five molecules in gas jar A, the \nnumber of ways of arranging the molecules is 25 = 32 \ndifferent ways. If we scaled this up to the numbers of \ngas molecules that we might find in a container in the \nlaboratory, the number of ways of arranging the \nmolecules is extremely large; for example, for a million \nmolecules between two gas jars it would be 21 000 000, a \nnumber that is too large for your calculator to deal with. \nSo diffusion happens because there is an overwhelming \nlikelihood of it taking place as a result of the large number \nof ways of arranging the molecules. The idea of the \n‘number of ways’ of arranging either molecules or the \nenergy within molecules dictates whether the changes \nthat take place are the ones that are most likely to happen. \nThis applies to chemical reactions as well as to physical \nprocesses such as diffusion.\n351\nQuestion\n1\t a\t \u0007For this question refer back to Figure 23.3. If \nthere are four molecules in the gas jar on the left, \nhow many ways of arranging the molecules are \nthere when the partition is removed?\nb\t \u0007What is the probability of finding all four \nmolecules in the right-hand gas jar?\nc\t\n\u0007Which of the following changes are likely to \nbe spontaneous?\ni\t\nsugar dissolving in water\nii\t \u0007the smell from an open bottle of aqueous \nammonia diffusing throughout a room\niii\t \u0007water turning to ice at 10 °C\niv\t ethanol vaporising at 20 °C\nv\t \u0007water mixing completely with cooking oil\nvi\t \u0007limestone (calcium carbonate) decomposing \nat room temperature\n\nComparing entropy values\nTo make any comparison of entropy values fair, we must \nuse standard conditions. These standard conditions are the \nsame as those used for ΔH:\n■\n■\na pressure of 105 Pa\n■\n■\na temperature of 298 K (25 °C)\n■\n■\neach substance involved in the reaction is in its normal \nphysical state (solid, liquid or gas) at 105 Pa and 298 K.\nUnder these conditions and for a mole of substance, the \nunit of standard molar entropy, S \nO\n—\n , is J K–1 mol–1. Standard \nmolar entropy is the entropy of one mole of substance in \nits standard state. The symbol \nO\n— indicates that the entropy \nis at standard conditions.\nTable 23.1 shows some values for some standard \nmolar entropies.\nSubstance\nS O\n—\n  / \n J K–1  mol–1\nSubstance\nS O\n—\n  /  \nJ K–1 mol–1\ndiamond (s)\n  2.4\nmethanol (l)\n239.7\ngraphite (s)\n  5.7\nwater (l)\n 69.9\ncalcium (s)\n 41.4\ncarbon \nmonoxide (g)\n197.6\nlead (s)\n 64.8\nhydrogen (g)\n130.6\n352\ncalcium oxide (s)\n 39.7\nhelium (g)\n126.0\ncalcium \ncarbonate (s)\n 92.9\nammonia (g)\n192.3\nmercury (l)\n 76.0\noxygen (g)\n205.0\nbromine (l)\n151.6\ncarbon \ndioxide (g)\n213.6\nTable 23.1  Standard molar entropy values of some solids, \nliquids and gases. The states are shown as state symbols after \neach substance.\nThe values of all standard molar entropies are positive. \nRemember that elements have positive standard molar \nentropy values. Do not get this muddled with the case of \nenthalpies, where the elements in their standard states \nhave entropy values of zero. The entropy values are \ncompared to a theoretically perfect crystal. The Third Law \nof Thermodynamics states that ‘All perfect crystals have \nthe same entropy at a temperature of absolute zero’. The \nnearest we can get to this is a perfect diamond weighing \n12 g cooled to as low a temperature as possible.\nFrom the values in the table and other data we can \nmake some generalisations:\n\n---\n\nFigure 23.4  A diamond has a very low entropy value because \nit is a solid element with atoms regularly arranged. Bromine \nhas a high entropy value because it tends to spread out.\ncarbonate (solid) has a higher entropy value than mercury \n(liquid).\n■\n■\nSimpler substances with fewer atoms have lower \nentropy values than more complex substances with a \ngreater number of atoms. For example, for calcium oxide, \nCaO, S O\n—\n = 39.7 J K–1 mol–1 but for calcium carbonate, \nCaCO3, S O\n—\n = 92.9 J K–1 mol–1. Carbon monoxide, CO, has a \nlower entropy value than carbon dioxide, CO2.\n■\n■\nFor similar types of substances, harder substances have \na lower entropy value. For example, diamond has a lower \nentropy value than graphite and calcium has a lower \nentropy value than lead.\n■\n■\nFor a given substance the entropy increases as a solid \nmelts and then changes to a vapour (see Figure 23.5). For \nexample, the molar entropy of ice just below its melting \npoint is 48.0 J K–1 mol–1; the molar entropy for water \nis 69.9 J K–1 mol–1, but just above its boiling point, the \nvalue increases to 188.7 J K–1 mol–1. There is a gradual \nincrease in entropy as the temperature of a substance is \nincreased. Increasing the temperature of a solid makes \nthe molecules, atoms or ions vibrate more. Increasing \nthe temperature of a liquid or gas increases the entropy \nbecause it increases the disorder of the particles. When \na substance melts or vaporises, there is a large increase \nin entropy because there is a very large increase in the \ndisorder of the particles.\nWhen a solid changes to a liquid:\n■\n■\nthe regularly arranged lattice of particles close together in \nthe solid changes to\n\nEntropy / J K–1\nboiling point\nmelting point\nTemperature / K\nFigure 23.5  The change in entropy as a substance melts and \nthen boils.\nWhen a liquid changes to a vapour:\n■\n■\nthe irregular arrangement of particles in the liquid which \nare close together and rotating changes to\n■\n■\nan irregular arrangement of particles, which are free to \nmove around rapidly because they are far apart from \neach other.\nQuestion\n2\t Explain the difference in the entropy of each of the \nfollowing pairs of substances in terms of their state \nand structure.\na\t \u0007Br2(l) S O\n—\n = 151.6 J K–1 mol–1 \nand I2(s) S O\n—\n = 116.8 J K–1 mol–1\nb\t \u0007H2(g) S O\n—\n = 130.6 J K–1 mol–1\nand CH4(g) S O\n—\n = 186.2 J K–1 mol–1\nc\t\n\u0007Hg(l) S O\n—\n = 76.00 J K–1 mol–1 \nand Na(s) S O\n—\n = 51.20 J K–1 mol–1\nd\t \u0007SO2(g) S O\n—\n = 248.1 J K–1 mol–1 \nand SO3(l) S O\n—\n = 95.60 J K–1 mol–1\nEntropy changes in reactions\nIn a chemical reaction, if we compare the entropies of \nthe reactants and products, we can try to explain the \nmagnitude of the entropy change and whether or not it \nincreases or decreases. We will assume that gases have \nhigh entropy and solids have low entropy. If there is a \nchange in the number of gaseous molecules in a reaction, \nthere is likely to be a significant entropy change. This is \n\n---\n\nbecause high values of entropy are associated with gases. \nThe more gas molecules, there are, the greater is the \nnumber of ways of arranging them and the higher the \nentropy. For example in the reaction:\nCaCO3(s) \n CaO(s)  +  CO2(g)\nthere is an increase in entropy of the system because the \na gas is being produced (high entropy) but the reactant, \ncalcium carbonate, is a solid (low entropy).\nIn the reaction\n2N2O5(g) \n 4NO2(g)  +  O2(g)\nwe should expect an increase of entropy of the system \nbecause there are a greater number of moles of gas \nmolecules in the products (5 molecules) than in the \nreactants (2 molecules). In addition, there are two \ndifferent product molecules but only one type of reactant \nmolecule. This also contributes to a greater disorder in \nthe products compared with the reactants. The system \nbecomes energetically more stable when it becomes \nmore disordered. \nIn the reaction \nN2(g)  +  3H2(g) \n 2NH3(g)\n353\nwe should expect a decrease in the entropy of the \nsystem because there is a reduction in the number of gas \nmolecules as the reaction proceeds. So the entropy change \nof the system is negative. The reactants, hydrogen and \nnitrogen, are more stable than the product, ammonia.\nQuestion\n3\t For each of the following reactions, suggest whether \nthe entropy of the reactants or the products will be \ngreater or whether it is difficult to decide.

          "content": "Calculating entropy changes\nEntropy changes in exothermic and \nendothermic reactions\nEnergy can be transferred from the system to the \nsurroundings (exothermic change) or from the \nsurroundings to the system (endothermic change). The \nsurroundings are so large that when energy exchange \ntakes place there is such a small change in temperature or \npressure that we can ignore these.\n■\n■\nFor an exothermic reaction, the energy released to the \nsurroundings increases the number of ways of arranging the \nenergy. This is because the energy goes into rotation and \ntranslation (movement from place to place) of molecules \nin the surroundings. So there is likely to be an increase in \nentropy and an increased probability of the chemical change \noccurring spontaneously.\n■\n■\nFor an endothermic reaction, the energy absorbed \nfrom the surroundings decreases the number of ways of \narranging the energy. So there is likely to be a decrease \nin entropy and a decreased probability of the chemical \nchange occurring spontaneously.\nTotal entropy change\nWe can use entropy values to predict whether a chemical \nreaction will occur spontaneously or not. When a \nchemical reaction takes place there is a change in entropy \nbecause the reactants and products have different entropy \nvalues. The symbol for standard entropy change is ΔS \nO\n—\n . \nThe total entropy change involves both the system and the \nsurroundings. For the system (reactants and products) we \nwrite the entropy change as ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem.\n354\nFor the surroundings we write the entropy change as \nΔS \nO\n—\nsurroundings.\nThe total entropy change is given by:\nΔS \nO\n—\ntotal = ΔS \nO\n—\nsystem  +  ΔS \nO\n—\nsurroundings\nIf the total entropy change increases, the entropy \nchange is positive, e.g. ΔS \nO\n—\ntotal is +40 J K–1 mol–1 .

How can the total entropy change be positive in \nboth directions? There is an additional increase in disorder \nand hence an increase in entropy associated with this \nmixing.

The reactants and \nproducts must be in their standard states.\nThe method of calculating Gibbs free energy change of \nreaction uses an energy cycle similar to the enthalpy cycles \nyou used to calculate the enthalpy change of reaction in \nChapter 6 (see Figure 23.8).\nΔG O\n—\nreaction\nreactants\nproducts\nΔG O\n—\n2\nΔG O\n—\n1\nelements in their\nstandard states\nFigure 23.8  A free energy cycle for calculating the standard \nGibbs free energy of reaction.

If we rearrange \nthe equation ΔG = ΔH – TΔS as ΔH = ΔG  +  TΔS, we can \nregard the +TΔS part as being the energy unavailable to do \nwork because it is involved with the disorder of the system. \nThe ΔG part is free energy that is available to do work, e.g. \ndriving the charge in electrochemical cells.\ntotal energy change\n∆G\nT∆S\nenergy available\nto do work\nenergy\nnot available\nto do work\nFigure 23.10  The enthalpy change of a reaction at constant \ntemperature can be split into two parts.\n\nGibbs free energy change and direction \nof chemical change\nGibbs free energy of formation is a measure of the stability \nof a compound. The more negative the value of ΔG \nO\n—\nf , the \ngreater the stability of the compound. It is unlikely to \ndecompose. If ΔG \nO\n—\nf is positive, the compound is likely to be \nunstable with respect to its elements.

Reactions with \nnegative values of ΔG \nO\n—\nreaction are likely to be feasible \n(spontaneous), whereas those with positive values are less \nlikely to be spontaneous.\n■\n■\nWhen a system is in chemical equilibrium and the amounts \nof products and reactants balance, the value of ΔG O\n—\nreaction \nis zero (ΔG O\n—\nreaction = 0).\n■\n■\nThe products predominate if the value of ΔG O\n—\nreaction has a \nfairly low negative value, e.g. –10 kJ mol–1.\n■\n■\nThe reactants predominate if the value of ΔG O\n—\nreaction has a \nslightly positive value, e.g. +10 kJ mol–1.\n■\n■\nThe reaction can be regarded as complete if the value of \nΔG O\n—\nreaction is high and negative, e.g. –60 kJ mol–1.\n362\nSummary\n■\t Entropy (S) is related to the degree of randomness \nor disorder in a system.

The co-ordination number of a \ncomplex is the number of co-ordinate (dative) bonds to the \ncentral metal ion. Some ligands can form two co-ordinate \nbonds from each ion or molecule to the transition metal \nion. These are called bidentate ligands, as shown in Figure \n24.6. Most ligands, such as water and ammonia, form just \none co-ordinate bond and are called monodentate ligands.\nA few transition metal ions, e.g. copper(I), silver(I), \ngold(I), form linear complexes with ligands.

The presence of a double bond in \n1,2-dibromoethane means that two geometrical isomers \n(cis-trans isomers) are possible. Geometric isomerism \nis also possible in transition metal complexes, where \nCH2\nNH2\nH2C\nH2N\nNH2\nNi\nCH2\nH2N\nNH2\nNH2\nH2C\nCH2\nen\nb\nen\nen\nNi\n\n---\n\nno double bond exists. In this case, the term geometric \nisomerism refers to complexes with the same molecular \nformula but different geometrical arrangements of their \natoms. Examples are cis- and trans-platin (Figure 24.8). \nIn cis-platin, the chlorine atoms are next to each other \nin the square complex but in trans-platin, they are \nopposite. The properties of these geometrical isomers \nare slightly different.\nNH3\nCI\nCl\nNH3\nPt\nPt\nCI\nNH3\nH3N\nCl\ncis-platin\ntrans-platin\nFigure 24.8  The geometrical isomers, cis-platin and \ntrans-platin.\nCis-platin has been used as an anti-cancer drug. It acts by \nbinding to sections of the DNA in cancer cells, preventing \ncell division.\nStereoisomerism is commonly shown by octahedral \n(six co-ordinate) complexes associated with bidentate \nligands. An example is the complex containing \nnickel as the transition metal and 1,2-diaminoethane \n(NH2CH2CH2NH2) as the bidentate ligand (Figure \n24.9). The two isomers are stereoisomers because the two \ndifferent molecules are mirror images of each other and \ncannot be superimposed.\n373\n2+\n2+\na\nCH2\nCH2\nH2N\nNH2\nH2N\nCH2\nNi\nH2C\nH2C\nNH2\nH2N\nH2N\nCH2\nCH2\n2+\n2+\nen\nNi\nen\nen\nFigure 24.9  The two non-superimposable optical isomers of Ni(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3\n2+: a  the full structure; b  a simplified structure \nwith ‘en’ representing a molecule of 1,2-diaminoethane.\n\nQuestion\n5\t a\t \u0007Cobalt forms a complex with the simplified \nstructure:\nNH2\nH2N\nCI\nCO\nCI\nH2N\nNH2\nthe curve represents CH2 CH2\ni\t\nGive the co-ordination number in this complex.\nii\t Draw the stereoisomer of this complex.\niii\t Explain why this is a stereoisomer.\nb\t \u0007Draw the two geometrical isomers of Ni(CN)2(Cl)2\n2–. \nLabel the cis-isomer and the trans-isomer. \nSubstitution of ligands\nThe ligands in a complex can be exchanged, wholly or \npartially, for other ligands. This is a type of substitution \nreaction. It happens if the new complex formed is \nmore stable than the original complex. The complexes \nof copper(II) ions can be used to show ligand \nsubstitution reactions.\nWhenever we write Cu2+(aq) we are really referring to \nthe complex ion [Cu(H2O)6]2+.

Write an equation to \nshow the ligand substitution reaction that takes \nplace in a positive test for water.\nFigure 24.12  A positive test for the presence of water \nusing anhydrous cobalt chloride paper.\n\n---\n\nStability constants\nAqueous solutions of transition element ions are hydrated. \nThey are complex ions with water as a ligand. Different \nligands form complexes with different stabilities. For \nexample when we add concentrated aqueous ammonia to \nan aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate, the ammonia \nligands displace water ligands in a stepwise process.\n[Cu(H2O)6]2+ (aq)  +  NH3(aq) \n [Cu(NH3)(H2O)5]2+(aq)  +  H2O(l)\n[Cu(NH3)(H2O)5]2+(aq)  +  NH3(aq) \n [Cu(NH3)2(H2O)4]2+(aq)  +  H2O(l)\nAs we increase the concentration of ammonia, this \nprocess continues until four of the water molecules are \nreplaced by ammonia to form a deep blue solution. The \noverall process is: \n[Cu(H2O)6]2+  +  4NH3(aq) \n [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+(aq)  +  4H2O(l)\nWe can think of this exchange of ligands in terms of \ncompeting equilibria of the forward and backward \nreactions. The position of equilibrium lies in the direction \nof the more stable complex. In this case, the complex with \nammonia as a ligand is more stable than the complex with \njust water as a ligand. If we dilute the complex with water, \nthe position of equilibrium shifts to the left and a complex \nwith more water molecules as ligands is formed.\nThe stability of the complex is expressed in terms of \nthe equilibrium constants for ligand displacement. This is \ncalled the stability constant. Usually an overall stability \nconstant, Kstab, is given rather than the stepwise constants. \nThe stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the \nformation of the complex ion in a solvent from its constituent \nions or molecules. The method for writing equilibrium \nexpressions for stability constants is similar to the one we \nused for writing Kc (see page 304). So for the equilibrium\n375\n[Cu(H2O)6]2+  +  4Cl–(aq) \n [CuCl4]2–(aq)  +  6H2O(l)\nthe expression is:\nKstab = ​ \n[[CuCl4]2–(aq)] \n_____________________ \n[[Cu(H2O)6]2+] [Cl–(aq)]4 ​\nNote:\n■\n■\nwater does not appear in the equilibrium expression \nbecause it is in such a large excess that its concentration is \nregarded as being constant\n\n■\n■\nthe units for the stability constant are worked out in the \nsame way as for the units of Kc (see page 124). For example, \nin the above case:\nKstab\t= ​ \n[[CuCl4]2–(aq)] \n_____________________ \n[[Cu(H2O)6]2+] [Cl–(aq)]4 ​ ​ \n(mol dm–3) \n_____________________ \n(mol dm–3) × (mol dm–3)4 ​\n= dm12 mol–4\nStability constants are often given on a log10 scale. When \nexpressed on a log10 scale, they have no units. Stability \nconstants can be used to compare the stability of any two \nligands. The values quoted usually give the stability of the \ncomplex relative to the aqueous ion where the ligand is \nwater. The higher the value of the stability constant, the \nmore stable the complex. Table 24.5 gives some values \nof stability constants for various copper(II) complexes \nrelative to their aqueous ions.\nLigand\nlog10 Kstab\nchloride, Cl–\n 5.6\nammonia, NH3\n13.1\n2-hydroxybenzoate\nCO2–\n16.9\n376\nOH\n25.0\n1,2-dihydroxybenzene\nOH\nOH\nTable 24.5  The stability constants of some complexes \nof copper.\nFrom the table you can see that, in general, complexes \nwith bidentate ions (2-hydroxybenzoate and \n1,2-dihydroxybenzene) have higher stability constants than \nthose with monodentate ligands. We can use the values of \nthe stability constants to predict the effect of adding different \nligands to complex ions. For example, the addition of excess \nammonia to the complex [CuCl4]2–(aq) should result in the \nformation of a dark blue solution of the ammonia complex \nbecause the stability constant of the ammonia complex is \nhigher than that of the chloride complex.

Would you expect to observe \nany changes? Explain your answer.\nThe colour of complexes\nYou cannot fail to notice the striking colours of complexes \ncontaining transition metal ions. But how do these colours \narise? White light is made up of all the colours of the \nvisible spectrum. When a solution containing a transition \nmetal ion in a complex appears coloured, part of the \nvisible spectrum is absorbed by the solution. However, that \nstill doesn’t explain why part of the spectrum is absorbed \nby transition metal ions. To answer this question we must \nlook in more detail at the d orbitals in the ions.\nThe five d orbitals in an isolated transition metal atom \nor ion are described as degenerate, meaning they are all at \nthe same energy level (Figure 24.13).\n\nz\ny\nx\nx\ndyz\nz\ny\nx\ndx2–y2\nFigure 24.13 The degenerate d orbitals in a transition metal atom.\nligands, the ligands are arranged in an octahedral shape \naround the central metal ion. Th e lone pairs donated by \nthe ligands into the transition metal ion repel electrons in \nthe two dx2–y2 and dz2 orbitals shown in Figure 24.13 more \nthan those in the other three d orbitals. Th is is because \nthese d orbitals line up with the co-ordinate bonds in \nthe complex’s octahedral shape and so they are closer to \nthe bonding electrons in the octahedral arrangement, \nincreasing repulsion between electrons. Th erefore the \norbitals are split, with these two d orbitals at a slightly \nhigher energy level than the dyz, dxz and dxy orbitals \n(Figure 24.14).\nA Cu2+ ion has an electronic confi guration of \n[Ar] 3d9. Figure 24.14 shows how the nine d electrons are \ndistributed between the non-degenerate orbitals formed \ndx2–y 2\ndz2\n3d\n∆E\nCu2+(...3d9)\ndegenerate\n3d orbitals\ndyz\ndxz\ndxy\nsplitting the \nd orbitals to give \nnon-degenerate\norbitals\nFigure 24.14 The splitting of the 3d orbitals in a Cu(H2O)6\n2+ complex ion.\n\n---\n\nz\nz\ny\ny\nx\ndxy\ndxz\nz\ny\nx\ndz2\nin a complex with ligands. Th e diff erence in the energy \nbetween the non-degenerate d orbitals is labelled ΔE. ΔE is \npart of the visible spectrum of light. So, when light shines \non the solution containing the Cu(H2O)6\n2+ complex, \nan electron absorbs this amount of energy. It uses this \nenergy to jump into the higher of the two non-degenerate \nenergy levels. In copper complexes, the rest of the visible \nspectrum that passes through the solution makes it appear \nblue in colour.\nTh e exact energy diff erence (ΔE) between the non-\ndegenerate d orbitals in a transition metal ion is aff ected \nby many factors. One of these factors is the identity of the \nligands that surround the transition metal ion. As you \nhave seen, a solution containing Cu(H2O)6\n2+ is a light blue, \nwhereas a solution containing Cu(NH3)2(H2O)2\n2+ is a very \n377\nexcited electron\nabsorbs energy\n∆E\nenergy absorbed\nfrom visible spectrum\nthat corresponds \nto ∆E\nthe energy absorbed can be\nworked out by the equation:\n∆E = hν\nwhereν is the frequency\nof light absorbed and\nh is Planck’s constant\n\ndeep shade of blue. The colour change arises because the \npresence of the ammonia ligands causes the d orbitals to \nsplit by a different amount of energy. This means that the \nsize of ΔE changes and this results in a slightly different \namount of energy being absorbed by electrons jumping \nup to the higher orbitals. Therefore a different colour is \nabsorbed from visible light, so a different colour is seen.\nSummary\n■\t Each of the transition elements forms at least one \nion with a partially filled d orbital.

          "content": "The benzene ring\nThe ‘benzene ring’ is a particularly important functional \ngroup found in many organic compounds. A benzene \nring is a hexagon made of six carbon atoms bonded \ntogether in a particular way. Benzene rings are found in \nmany compounds that are commercially important – for \nexample as medicines, dyes and plastics.\nOrganic hydrocarbons containing one or more \nbenzene rings are called arenes. In general, compounds \nof benzene are known as aryl compounds or aromatic \ncompounds; an example is chlorobenzene, which is one of \nthe halogenoarenes.\nThe simplest arene is benzene itself. Its formula is \nC6H6. The early organic chemists struggled to work out \nits structure. However, around 1865 Friedrich August \nKekulé seemed to have solved the problem. He proposed \na hexagonal ring of carbon atoms, each bonded to one \nhydrogen atom. In Kekulé’s structure the hexagonal ring \ncontained three double C   C bonds (Figure 25.2).\n382\nThis is reflected in benzene’s name, which has the same \nending as the alkenes.\nH\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nalso shown as\nC\nC\nC\nH\nH\nH\nFigure 25.2  Kekulé’s structure of benzene.\n\n---\n\nFigure 25.1  This is a vanilla \norchid. Its seed pods contain \na substance called vanillin. \nIts molecules are based on a \nbenzene ring – as represented by \nthe hexagon with a circle inside \nin the structure shown below. \nVanillin is used to flavour foods \nsuch as ice cream and chocolate. \nIts structure is:\nOH\nO\nCH3\nO\nC\nH\nAs analytical techniques were developed, however, \nchemists found out that the benzene molecule was a \nplanar, perfectly symmetrical molecule. Kekulé’s structure \nwould suggest three shorter double C   C bonds and three \nlonger single C   C bonds in the ring. This would produce \na distorted hexagonal shape, not the perfect hexagonal \narrangement of carbon atoms in benzene’s actual \nmolecules. Figure 25.3 shows how we represent benzene’s \nskeletal formula.\nFigure 25.3  The skeletal formula of benzene. It can also be \nused in displayed formulae of aryl compounds, as on the \nprevious page showing the structure of vanillin.\nWe can now measure actual bond lengths. This was \nimpossible in the 19th century when Kekulé worked. \nTable 25.1 shows that the bond length of the carbon–\ncarbon bonds in benzene lie between the values for C   C \nsingle bonds and C   C double bonds.\nBond\nBond length / nm\nC   C\n0.154\nC   C\n0.134\ncarbon to carbon bond in benzene\n0.139\nTable 25.1  Comparing bond lengths.\n\nThe chemistry of benzene also suggests that the Kekulé \nstructure is incorrect. If there were three C   C bonds \nin benzene it would undergo addition reactions like the \nalkenes (see page 209). However, this is not the case. For \nexample, ethene will decolorise bromine water on mixing, \nbut benzene needs much harsher conditions.\nThe actual structure of benzene can be explained by \nconsidering the bonding in the molecule. Each carbon \natom in the hexagonal ring is sp2 hybridised (see page 57), \nsharing:\n■\n■\none pair of electrons with one of its neighbouring \ncarbon atoms\n■\n■\none pair of electrons with its other neighbouring \ncarbon atom\n■\n■\none pair of electrons with a hydrogen atom.\nThese are σ (sigma) bonds; covalent bonds with the pair \nof electrons found mainly between the nuclei of the atoms \nbonded to each other. Each carbon atom forms three σ \nbonds. That leaves one electron spare on each of the six \ncarbon atoms. Each carbon atom contributes this one \nelectron to a π (pi) bond (see page 57). However, the π \nbonds formed are not localised between pairs of carbon \natoms as in an alkene C   C bond (see page 193). Instead, \nthe π bonds in benzene spread over all six carbon atoms \nin the hexagonal ring. The six electrons in the π bonds are \nsaid to be delocalised.\nThe π bonding in benzene is formed by the overlap \nof carbon p atomic orbitals, one from each of the six \ncarbon atoms. To achieve maximum overlap, the benzene \nmolecule must be planar. The lobes of the p orbitals \noverlap to form a ring of delocalised electrons above \nand below the plane of the carbon atoms in the benzene \nmolecule. This is shown in Figure 25.4.\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\nH\noverlap of p orbitals \nproduces a ring of \ndelocalised electrons \nabove and below the \nplane of benzene’s \ncarbon atoms\nFigure 25.4  The π bonding in benzene. The three bond angles \naround each of the sp2 hybridised carbon atoms are 120°.\n\n---\n\nNaming aryl compounds\nYou saw how to name aryl compounds with alkyl side-\nchains on page 193. Some aryl compounds have functional \ngroups that are substituted directly into the benzene ring \nin place of a hydrogen atom.

          "content": "Reactions of arenes\nMost reactions of benzene maintain the highly stable \ndelocalised ring of π bonding electrons intact. This occurs \nby substituting an atom, or group of atoms, for one or more \nhydrogen atoms attached to the benzene ring. The initial \nattack is usually by an electrophile, which is attracted to the \nhigh electron density around the benzene ring.\n384\nElectrophilic substitution with chlorine \nor bromine\nBenzene will react with bromine in the presence of an \nanhydrous iron(III) bromide catalyst. The catalyst can be \nmade in the reaction vessel by adding iron filings to the \nbenzene and bromine. The substitution reaction is:\nBr\nanhydrous\nFeBr3 catalyst\n+ HBr\n+ Br2\nAt first sight the electrophile that starts the attack on \nbenzene is not obvious. The electrophile is created when \nan iron(III) bromide molecule polarises a bromine \nmolecule. The Br2 molecule forms a dative (co-ordinate) \nbond with iron(III) bromide by donating a lone pair of \nelectrons from one bromine atom into an empty 3d orbital \nin the iron. This draws electrons from the other bromine \natom in the Br2 molecule making it partially positive, \ncreating the electrophile. \n\n---\n\nWe can think of the electrophile as a Br+ cation:\nBr\nBr\nFeBr3\nBr+\n+ [FeBr4]–\nδ+\nδ–\nThe Br+ cation and the ‘electron-rich’ benzene ring are \nattracted to each other, as the mechanism below shows. \nRemember that the curly arrows show the movement of a \npair of electrons.\nBr\nH\nBr\nstage 1\n⎯⎯⎯→\n⎯⎯⎯→\nstage 2\n+ HBr\n[FeBr4]–\n(+FeBr3)\nBr+\n+\nA similar reaction happens when chlorine gas is bubbled \nthrough benzene at room temperature in the presence \nof a catalyst such as iron(III) chloride or aluminium \nchloride. The products of this electrophilic substitution \nare chlorobenzene and hydrogen chloride. The catalysts in \nthese reactions, i.e. FeBr3, AlCl3 and FeCl3, are known as \n‘halogen carriers’.\nWhen we halogenate methylbenzene or other \nalkylarenes, the halogen atom substitutes into the benzene \nring at positions 2 or 4. These positions are ‘activated’ \nby any electron-donating groups bonded directly to the \nbenzene ring (see Table 25.4 on page 390). Other \nexamples of benzene compounds that are activated in \nthese positions are phenol and phenylamine. So when \nwe react methylbenzene with chlorine gas, using an \nanhydrous aluminium chloride catalyst, two products can \nbe made:\nCH3\nCH3\nCl\nCH3\nAlCl3\n + \n+ 2HCl\n + 2Cl2\nCl\n2-chloromethyl-\n4-chloromethyl-\nbenzene\nbenzene\nIf excess chlorine gas is bubbled through, we can \nform 1-methyl-2,4-dichlorobenzene, 1-methyl-2,6-\ndichlorobenzene and 1-methyl-2,4,6-trichlorobenzene. \n(Remember that the 2 and 6 positions in substituted arenes \nare equivalent.)\nThe carbon–halogen bond in halogenoarenes is \nstronger than the equivalent bond in a halogenoalkane \nbecause one of the lone pairs on the halogen atom \noverlaps slightly with the π bonding system in the benzene \nring. This gives the carbon–halogen bond a partial double \nbond character.\n\nNotice that the methyl side-chain is not affected under the \nconditions used in the reaction above. However, we learnt \non page 206 that chlorine will react with alkanes in the \npresence of ultraviolet (UV) light or strong sunlight. This \nis a free radical substitution reaction. So if the chlorine gas \nis passed into boiling methylbenzene, in the presence of \nUV light, the following reaction takes place:\nCH3\nCH2Cl\nboil\n + HCl\n UV light\n + Cl2\nchloromethyl-\nbenzene\nNote that there is no substitution into the benzene ring \nunder these conditions. In excess chlorine, eventually all \nthree of the hydrogen atoms on the methyl side-chain will \nbe replaced by chlorine atoms.\nQuestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007Write the equation for the reaction of chlorine \nwith benzene in the presence of an iron(III) \nchloride catalyst.\n\u0007b\t \u0007What do we call this type of mechanism for the \nreaction in part a?\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Draw the mechanism of the reaction in part a, with \nCl+ as the attacking species and using curly arrows \nto show the movement of electron pairs.\n\u0007d\t \u0007Draw the displayed formula of the ‘tri-substituted’ \nhalogenoarene produced if methylbenzene is \nadded to excess bromine at room temperature in \nthe presence of iron(III) bromide.\n\u0007e\t \u0007How would the reaction in part d differ if the \nmethylbenzene and bromine were boiled in the \npresence of UV light?\n\u0007f\t\n\u0007Name the mechanism of the reaction in part e.\nNitration of benzene\nThe nitration of benzene is another example of an \nelectrophilic substitution. Nitration refers to the \nintroduction of the NO2 group into a molecule. In this \nreaction the electrophile is the NO2\n+ ion, known as the \n\n---\n\nnitronium ion (or nitryl cation). This is made from a \nmixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated \nsulfuric acid:\nHNO3  +  2H2SO4 \n NO2\n+  +  2HSO4\n–  +  H3O+\nThis ‘nitrating mixture’ is refluxed with benzene at about \n55 °C to make nitrobenzene:\nNO2\n+ HNO3\n+ H2O\n⎯→\nThe mechanism of the electrophilic substitution is:\nNO2\nH\nNO2\n+\nstage 1\nstage 2\nNO2\n+\n+ H+\nIn stage 1 in the mechanism, the electrophile, NO2\n+, is \nattracted to the high electron density of the π bonding \nsystem in benzene. A pair of electrons from the benzene \nring is donated to the nitrogen atom in NO2\n+, and forms \na new covalent bond. At this point, benzene’s delocalised \nring of electrons is disrupted. There are now four π \nbonding electrons and a positive charge spread over five \ncarbon atoms.\nHowever, the full delocalised ring is restored in stage 2 \nwhen the C   H bond breaks heterolytically. Both electrons in \nthe C   H covalent bond go into nitrobenzene’s π bonding \nsystem, and hydrogen leaves as an H+ ion. There are now \nsix electrons spread over the six carbon atoms, so the \nchemical stability of the benzene ring is retained in this \nsubstitution reaction.\nFurther nitration of the nitrobenzene produces \n1,3-dinitrobenzene and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene. Unlike \nthe electron-donating methyl group in methylbenzene \n(which activates the 2 and 4 positions in the benzene \nring), the NO2 group is electron-withdrawing. This type \nof group (which includes COOH) deactivates the 2 and \n4 positions in the benzene ring. Therefore, when there \nis a nitro group bonded to the benzene ring, further \nsubstitution takes place at the 3 and 5 positions (see Table \n25.4, page 390).\n385\n\nQuestion\n4\t \u0007a\t \u0007Copy and complete the two equations below, \nwhich can be used to show the nitration of \nmethylbenzene:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007C6H5CH3  +  NO2\n+ \n  +  \n H2SO4\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007C6H5CH3  +  HNO3 \n  +  \n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007Name the possible mono-substituted products \nin parts i and ii.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iv\t \u00071-methyl-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 1-methyl-\n2,4,6-trinitrobenzene are formed on further \nnitration of methylbenzene. Draw the \ndisplayed formula of each compound.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Benzene also undergoes electrophilic substitution \nwhen refluxed with fuming sulfuric acid for several \nhours. This is called sulfonation.

Examples include \nthe manufacture of detergents or the reactants needed to \nmake plastics, such as poly(phenylethene) – commonly \nknown as polystyrene. They can use a Friedel–Crafts \nreaction to substitute a hydrogen in the benzene ring for \nan alkyl group, such as a methyl (  CH3) or an ethyl \n(  C2H5) group:\nCH3\nCH2CH3\nethylbenzene\nmethylbenzene\n\n---\n\nThe same type of reaction can also be used to introduce an \nacyl group into a benzene ring.

We can explain this \nby looking at the conjugate bases formed on the right-hand \nside of the equations in Table 25.3. The phenoxide ion, \nC6H5O–(aq), has its negative charge spread over the whole \nion as one of the lone pairs on the oxygen atom overlaps \nwith the delocalised π bonding system in the benzene ring.\n–\nO\nO–\nCH3CH2\nethoxide ion, with\nphenoxide ion,\nwith negative\ncharge spread over\nthe whole ion\nnegative charge\nconcentrated on\n388\nthe oxygen\nThis delocalisation reduces the charge density of the \nnegative charge on the phenoxide ion compared with \nOH–(aq) or C2H5O–(aq). Therefore H+(aq) ions are not \nas strongly attracted to the phenoxide ion as they are to \nhydroxide or ethoxide ions, making phenoxide ions less \nlikely to re-form the undissociated molecules.\nAlternatively, we can explain the greater acidity of \nphenol by saying that phenol ionises to form a more \nstable negative ion, so the ionisation of phenol is more \nlikely. This results in the position of equilibrium in the \nphenol equation in Table 25.3 lying further to the right-\nhand side (i.e. more molecules donating an H+ ion) than \nthe other equations.\nEthanol is a weaker acid than water because of the \nelectron-donating alkyl (ethyl) group attached to the \noxygen atom in the ethoxide ion. This has the effect of \nconcentrating more negative charge on this oxygen atom, \nwhich more readily accepts an H+ ion. This explains why \nthe position of equilibrium lies further to the left-hand \nside, favouring the undissociated ethanol molecules.\n\n---\n\nQuestion\n7\t \u0007a\t \u0007Place the following molecules in order of their \nacidity, starting with the most acidic:\nCH3COOH C6H5OH HCl  C3H7OH H2O\n\u0007b\t \u0007Would you expect methanol to be more or less \nacidic than phenol?

          "content": "The acidity of carboxylic acids\nCarboxylic acids display the typical reactions of all \nacids due to the presence of excess H+(aq) ions in their \naqueous solutions (see page 307). For example, they react \nwith bases to form a salt plus water. Their salts are called \ncarboxylates. The carboxylate salt formed by the reaction \nof ethanoic acid with sodium hydroxide is called sodium \nethanoate, CH3COO–Na+.\nThe carboxylic acids are weak acids. The majority of \ntheir molecules are undissociated in water. For example:\n394\nCH3COOH(aq) \n CH3COO–(aq)  +  H+(aq)\nethanoic acid\t\nethanoate ion\nThe position of this equilibrium lies well over to the left-hand \nside. The dissociation constant, Ka, of ethanoic acid at 25 °C is \n1.7 × 10–5 mol dm–3 (see page 308).

The carboxylic acids \nprepared are not usually oxidised any further.\nHowever, methanoic acid (HCOOH) is a stronger \nreducing agent than other carboxylic acids, so it can \nundergo further oxidation.\nO\nH\nH\nC\nO\nFigure 26.3  The displayed formula of methanoic acid.\nThis involves the oxidising agent breaking down the \nmethanoic acid molecule, forming carbon dioxide. This \noxidation can be carried out even by warming with mild \noxidising agents (such as the Fehling’s or Tollens’ reagents \nused to distinguish between aldehydes and ketones – see \npage 239).\nIn a positive test for an aldehyde, the Cu2+ ion in \nFehling’s solution is reduced to the Cu+ ion, which \nprecipitates out as red copper(I) oxide. When methanoic \nacid is oxidised by Fehling’s solution, the same positive \ntest result is obtained. With Tollens’ reagent, the silver ion \npresent, Ag+, is reduced to silver metal when it oxidises \nmethanoic acid (also as in the positive test for \nan aldehyde).\nThe half-equation for the oxidation of methanoic acid \ncan be written in terms of electron transfer to an oxidising \nagent as:\n395\noxidation\n HCOOH \n CO2  +  2H+(aq)  +  2e–\noxidation number\t\n+2\t\n+4\nor in terms of the addition of oxygen from an oxidising \nagent as:\nHCOOH  +  [O] \n CO2  +  H2O\nThis oxidation of methanoic acid will also occur with \nstronger oxidising agents such as acidified solutions of \npotassium manganate(VII) – decolorising the purple \nsolution – or potassium dichromate(VI) – turning the \norange solution green.",

The carboxylic acids \nprepared are not usually oxidised any further.\nHowever, methanoic acid (HCOOH) is a stronger \nreducing agent than other carboxylic acids, so it can \nundergo further oxidation.\nO\nH\nH\nC\nO\nFigure 26.3  The displayed formula of methanoic acid.\nThis involves the oxidising agent breaking down the \nmethanoic acid molecule, forming carbon dioxide. This \noxidation can be carried out even by warming with mild \noxidising agents (such as the Fehling’s or Tollens’ reagents \nused to distinguish between aldehydes and ketones – see \npage 239).\nIn a positive test for an aldehyde, the Cu2+ ion in \nFehling’s solution is reduced to the Cu+ ion, which \nprecipitates out as red copper(I) oxide. When methanoic \nacid is oxidised by Fehling’s solution, the same positive \ntest result is obtained. With Tollens’ reagent, the silver ion \npresent, Ag+, is reduced to silver metal when it oxidises \nmethanoic acid (also as in the positive test for \nan aldehyde).\nThe half-equation for the oxidation of methanoic acid \ncan be written in terms of electron transfer to an oxidising \nagent as:\n395\noxidation\n HCOOH \n CO2  +  2H+(aq)  +  2e–\noxidation number\t\n+2\t\n+4\nor in terms of the addition of oxygen from an oxidising \nagent as:\nHCOOH  +  [O] \n CO2  +  H2O\nThis oxidation of methanoic acid will also occur with \nstronger oxidising agents such as acidified solutions of \npotassium manganate(VII) – decolorising the purple \nsolution – or potassium dichromate(VI) – turning the \norange solution green.\n\nAnother common example of a carboxylic acid that can \nbe oxidised by these stronger oxidising agents is \nethanedioic acid (a dicarboxylic acid). Its molecular \nformula is H2C2O4. Its structural formula is HOOCCOOH \nor (COOH)2, and its displayed formula is shown in \nFigure 26.4.\nO\nO\nC\nH\nC\nO\nO\nH\nFigure 26.4  The displayed formula of ethanedioic acid.\nA solution of ethanedioic acid (with sulfuric acid added) \ncan be used in titrations to standardise a solution of \npotassium manganate(VII).

The solid ethanedioic acid can be weighed \nout accurately to make a standard solution of known \nconcentration. This is warmed in a conical flask and the \npotassium manganate(VII) solution to be standardised \nis run in from a burette. The end-point of the titration \nis identified when the addition of a drop of the purple \nmanganate(VII) solution turns the solution pink.

However, the synthetic reactions that are \nneeded can be difficult to do because carboxylic acids are \nquite unreactive. One way round this is to first convert \nthe carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Acyl chlorides are \nmuch more reactive than carboxylic acids.\nAs we saw on page 396, an acyl chloride is similar \nin structure to a carboxylic acid, with the \n OH group \nreplaced by a Cl atom. So the \n COOH functional group \nis changed to the \n COCl group. The structural formula of \nacyl chlorides can be written as ROCl, where R is an alkyl \nor aryl group. For example, propanoyl chloride can be \nwritten as CH3CH2COCl.\nThe structural formulae of benzoic acid and its \nderivative benzoyl chloride are shown in Figure 26.5.\nCl\nO\nH\nO\nO\nC\nC\nderived from\nbenzoyl chloride\nbenzoic acid\nFigure 26.5  Benzoyl chloride is the acyl chloride derived from \nbenzoic acid.\nAcyl chlorides are reactive compounds. The carbonyl \ncarbon has electrons drawn away from it by the Cl atom as \nwell as by its O atom, and both are strongly electronegative \natoms. This gives the carbonyl carbon a relatively large \npartial positive charge and makes it particularly open to \nattack from nucleophiles.\nδ–\nO\nδ+\nC\nδ–\nCl\nThe acyl chlorides are reactive liquids. When they react \nwith nucleophiles the C   Cl bond breaks and white fumes \nof hydrogen chloride, HCl, are given off. To generalise \ntheir reactions, we can write:\nROCl  +  HZ \n ROZ  +  HCl\nwhere HZ can be water, an alcohol, ammonia or an amine. \nNotice that HZ contains either an oxygen or nitrogen atom \nwith a lone pair of electrons that can be donated. HZ can \ntherefore act as a nucleophile.\n\n---\n\nHydrolysis of acyl chlorides\nWater is a suitable nucleophile to attack an acyl \nchloride molecule. A lone pair on the oxygen atom \nin water initiates the attack on the δ+ carbonyl \ncarbon atom. The reaction produces a carboxylic \nacid and hydrogen chloride. It is an example of \na hydrolysis reaction, i.e. the breakdown of a \ncompound by water. For example:\nCH3CH2COCl  +  H2O \n CH3CH2COOH  +  HCl\npropanoyl chloride\t\npropanoic acid\nThe acyl chloride can be added to water using \na dropping pipette. The reaction is immediate \nand white fumes of HCl are observed rising from \nthe liquid.\nFigure 26.6 shows the mechanism of the hydrolysis, \nshowing the initial attack by a water molecule, acting as a \nnucleophile, followed by the elimination of a molecule of \nhydrogen chloride.\n397\nH\nH\nO\nH\nH\nO\n+\nH\nO\nCH3C\nCl\nO\nδ+\nCH3C\nC\nC\nCH3C\n+ HCl\nO\nCl\nO–\nFigure 26.6  The condensation (addition-elimination) \nmechanism of hydrolysis of ethanoyl chloride.\nThe hydrolysis can be classified as a condensation reaction, \nas there is an initial addition reaction of water across the \nC   O bond, followed by elimination of a small molecule, \nin this case HCl.\nThis reaction is far more vigorous than the hydrolysis \nof chloroalkanes (see page 219). The hydrolysis of \nchloroalkanes needs a strong alkali, such as aqueous \nsodium hydroxide, to be refluxed with the chloroalkane \nto hydrolyse it. The nucleophile needed to hydrolyse a \nchloroalkane is the negatively charged hydroxide ion, OH–. \nHowever, a neutral water molecule is sufficient to hydrolyse \nan acyl chloride quickly at room temperature. This \ndifference is due to the carbon bonded to the chlorine atom \nin a chloroalkane not being as strongly δ+ as the carbon \natom in an acyl chloride. Remember, in an acyl chloride \nthe carbon bonded to the chlorine atom is also attached\n\nto an oxygen atom. It has two strongly electronegative \natoms pulling electrons away from it. Therefore the attack \nby the nucleophile is much more rapid.\nAryl chlorides, such as chlorobenzene, will not \nundergo hydrolysis. The carbon atom bonded to the \nchlorine atom is part of the delocalised π bonding system \nof the benzene ring. The p orbitals from the Cl atom tend \nto overlap with the delocalised p electrons in the benzene \nring. This causes the C — Cl bond to have some double \nbond character, making it stronger, and hydrolysis does \nnot occur.\nThe ease of hydrolysis, starting with the compounds most \nreadily broken down, is:\nacyl chloride > chloroalkane > aryl chloride\nquestions\n4\t \u0007In its reaction with a nucleophile, explain why an acyl \nchloride reacts faster than an alcohol.\n5\t \u0007a\t \u0007Name the products of the hydrolysis of \npropanoyl chloride.\n398\n\u0007b\t \u0007i\t\n\u0007Place the following compounds in order of \nease of hydrolysis, starting with the most \nreactive first.\n\u0007C6H5Cl    \u0007CH3CH2COCl    \u0007CH3CH2CH2Cl\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007Explain your answer to part i.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007If a reaction occurs with water, what will you \nsee in part i?\nQuestion\nReaction with alcohols and phenol\nWhen acyl chlorides react with alcohols and phenol, we \nget esters (and HCl) formed. The reactions happen more \nquickly than the reactions of alcohols or phenol with \ncarboxylic acids. The acyl chloride reactions also go to \ncompletion and do not form an equilibrium mixture. \nTherefore they are useful in the synthesis of esters in the \nchemical industry.\nEthanoyl chloride will react vigorously with ethanol to \nform an ester:\nO\nO\nCH3C\nC2H5OH\n+ HCl\n+ \nCH3C\nCl\nOC2H5\nethanol\n\n---\n\nWith phenol, the reaction with an acyl chloride proceeds \nif warmed.

For example, a primary amine is an \nammonia molecule with one of its H atoms replaced by an \nalkyl or aryl group. Ammonia and the amines act as bases \nbecause of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. \nRemember that a base is a proton (H+ ion) acceptor.

Remember \nthat the 2, 4 and 6 positions around the benzene ring are \nactivated when electron-donating groups, such as \n NH2 \nor \n OH, are attached to the ring:\nNH2\nBr\nBr\nNH2\n+ 3Br2\n+ 3HBr\nBr\n2,4,6-tribromophenylamine\nThis reaction is called diazotisation. Note that the positive \ncharge on the diazonium ion (C6H5N2\n+) is on the nitrogen \natom shown with four bonds in the equation above.\nThe reaction mixture must be kept below 10 °C using \nice. This is because the diazonium salt is unstable and \nwill decompose easily, giving off nitrogen gas, N2, at \nhigher temperatures.\n403\nDiazotisation\nPhenylamine is an important compound in the \nsynthesis of dyes. The first step is the reaction \nbetween phenylamine and nitrous acid (nitric(III) \nacid), HNO2, to give a diazonium salt. Nitrous \nacid is unstable, so it has to be made in the test \ntube, then the phenylamine added. We can make \nthe nitrous acid using sodium nitrite (sodium \nnitrate(III)) and dilute hydrochloric acid:\nNaNO2  +  HCl \n HNO2  +  NaCl\nnitrous acid\nThe first step in the synthesis of a dye is the \nproduction of benzenediazonium chloride:\nN\nNCl– + 2H2O\n+\nNH2 + HNO2 + HCl\nbenzenediazonium\nchloride",

We can use it with amino acids and peptides \nobtained when a protein is hydrolysed.\nThe analytical technique of electrophoresis is based on \nseparating ions placed in an electric field. If a sample is \nplaced between two electrodes, positively charged ions will \nmove towards a negatively charged electrode. Negatively \ncharged ions will move towards a positively charged \nelectrode (Figure 27.10).\nporous\ndiffusion\nbarrier\npaper\nsupports\nperspex\ncover\nelectrode\nmoulded plastic\ncontainer\nbuffer\nsolution\nFigure 27.10  This apparatus shows how paper \nelectrophoresis is carried out.\nThe sample is placed on absorbent paper or on a gel \nsupported on a solid base such as a glass plate. A buffer \nsolution carries the ions along. The rate at which the ions \nmove towards the oppositely charged electrode depends, \namong other things, on the size and charge on the ions: \nlarger ions will move more slowly; highly charged ions \nwill move more quickly. Therefore the ions are separated \nas the electric field is applied. You get a series of lines \nor bands on the paper or gel once a chemical is applied. \nSometimes ultraviolet light is used to show the bands \nup. The series of bands is called an electropherogram \n(Figure 27.11).\nLet us consider a simple example of how a mixture \nof three amino acids undergoes separation.

          "content": "Synthetic polyamides\nProteins have their monomers bonded to each other \nvia peptide links (also called amide links in synthetic \npolymers such as nylons). This means that polypeptides \nand proteins are types of polyamide.\nFor the last 80 years, chemists have used condensation \npolymerisation to make synthetic polyamides. Nylon \nis a polyamide. Nylon can be made from a variety of \nmonomers, but all nylons are made in reactions between \nthe amine group (\n NH2) and a carboxylic acid \n(\n  COOH) or acyl chloride group (\n  COCl).\nFor example, 1,6-diaminohexane reacts with \nhexanedioic acid to make nylon 6,6:\nOH\nO\natoms lost to form water\n(CH2)4\nC\nC\nH\nH HO\nO\n(CH2)6\nN\nN\nH\nH\nO\nH\n(CH2)4\nC\nC\n+\nH2O\n(CH2)6\nN\nN\nO n\nH\namide link\nor peptide link\nThe numbers used in nylon 6,6 refer to the number of \ncarbon atoms in each monomer unit.\nHexanedioyl dichloride, ClOC(CH2)4COCl, can be \nused as a more reactive, but more expensive, monomer \nthan hexanedioic acid.\nNylon 6 is the only example of a nylon polymer that \nis not formed by a condensation reaction; instead it is \nmade from the compound caprolactam, which is a cyclic \namide. When heated in an atmosphere of nitrogen the ring \nbreaks open at the amide group. The resulting chains join \ntogether to make nylon 6 (Figure 28.2).\nO\nO\n→\nn\nN\nH\nN\nH\nn\ncaprolactam\n\n---\n\nNote that caprolactam is made from 6-aminohexanoic \nacid, with its NH2 group and COOH group at either end of \nthe molecule. They react with each other in a condensation \nreaction, releasing water. It is easier to visualise the \nformation of nylon 6 as the condensation polymerisation \nof 6-aminohexanoic acid (which would follow the \nusual pattern of condensation polymerisation to form \na polyamide).\nNylon’s low density, its strength and its elasticity \nmake it a very useful fibre in the clothing industry. \nThese properties also make it ideal for climbing ropes \n(Figure 28.3). During the manufacturing process, the \nnylon is forced out of nozzles and pulled into long fibres. \nThis is called ‘cold drawing’. It lines up the nylon polymer \nchains along the length of the fibre. Strong hydrogen \nbonds form between neighbouring chains, accounting for \nnylon’s high tensile strength and elasticity.\n413\nFigure 28.3  Climbers rely on nylon’s elasticity and high \ntensile strength to minimise the effects of a fall.\n\na\nb\nO\nO\nC\nN\nC\nN\nO\nn\nH\nH\nC\nO\nC\nO\nC\nFigure 28.4  a  The formula showing the repeat of Kevlar®. b  The hydrogen bonding between chains of the polyamide.

This 3-D shape \nis stabilised by attractive forces and bonding between the \namino acid side-chains (R groups).\nEach protein has its own, unique, function because each \nprotein has its own, unique, 3-D shape.\nPrimary structure\nThe primary structure is the order in which the \namino acids are linked together.

          "content": "Designing useful polymers\nLow-density and high-density \npoly(ethene)\nIn the 1930s the first type of polyalkene formed was low-\ndensity poly(ethene) (LDPE) and it is still useful today. Its \nnon-polar polymer chains interact with each other by van \nder Waals’ forces. As the chains are heavily branched, not \nstraight chains, these intermolecular forces are relatively \nweak for such large molecules. The random branching \nmakes it impossible for the polymer chains to pack neatly \ntogether and accounts for its low density and low melting \ntemperature (see Figure 28.20).\nThen in the 1950s a chemist called Karl Ziegler \ndiscovered a catalyst that helped produce poly(ethene) \nconsisting of straight chains, showing that reaction \nconditions can affect the nature of the polymer formed. \nThis new type of poly(ethene) had different properties. \nIts unbranched polymer chains could pack closely \ntogether (see Figure 28.21) and formed high-density \npoly(ethene) (HDPE). \n422\nFigure 28.20  The branched chains of LDPE. The van der Waals’ \nforces between the non-polar polymer chains are affected not \nonly by the size of the chains but also their inability to pack \nclosely together, reducing the effectiveness of instantaneous \ndipoles in one chain to induce dipoles on neighbouring chains.\n\n---\n\nThis is a much stronger plastic and has a higher melting \ntemperature. Therefore HDPE can be used to make \nwater pipes and containers that can be sterilised with \nboiling water. This demonstrates the importance of the \nintermolecular forces between polymer chains when \nconsidering the properties of polymeric materials.\nAnother example of this is the difference in properties \nbetween natural rubber and synthetic rubbers. From the \n1930s, chemists have tried to mimic natural polymers. \nFinding synthetic substitutes for rubber and silk, for \nexample, offered the chance to produce cheaper materials \nwith improved properties. Neoprene, a synthetic rubber, \nand nylon, a synthetic polyamide, were both products \ndiscovered at that time. Neoprene was made from the \npolymerisation of the monomer 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene in \nan addition reaction:\nThe monomer of natural rubber is 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, \nwhich is very similar to the monomer for neoprene. The \nintermolecular forces between natural rubber polymers \nare van der Waals’ forces. A process called vulcanisation \nwas invented to make rubber tyres more resilient and \nhardwearing. This links rubber polymer chains by \ncovalent bonds across ‘sulfur bridges’ (Figure 28.22).\nquestion\n9\t \u0007a\t \u0007The word ‘resilient’ means to return to the original \nform or position after being bent, compressed or \nstretched. Explain why the process of vulcanising \nmakes rubber ‘more resilient’.\n\u0007b\t \u0007Give an equation to show the polymerisation of \n2-methyl-1,3-butadiene to form rubber.\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Using the concept of intermolecular forces, explain \nwhy HDPE could be used to make containers that \ncan be sterilised by boiling water but LDPE cannot.\n\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH\nCH\nCH\nS\nCH2\nCH2\nCH\nCH2\nCH\nCH\nCH\nCH\nCH2\nCH\nS\nS\nFigure 28.22  The sulfur bridges between polymer chains make rubber more resilient.\nNon-solvent-based adhesives\nTraditional adhesives (glues) use an organic solvent to \ndissolve a polymer that will stick two surfaces together. \nAfter applying the adhesive, the solvent evaporates off and \nthe solid polymer is left behind and acts as the glue. The \nsolvent used is often the ester, ethyl ethanoate, as it has a \nlow toxicity and is volatile. However, it is flammable and \nother organic solvents used in adhesives are harmful to \nhealth. Therefore chemists have developed glues that do \nnot rely on organic solvents that are a source of pollution.\nThe main component of non-solvent-based adhesives \nis often a polymer that contains silicon bonded to oxygen. \nThey set (or cure) by reacting with the moisture present \nin air. The water hydrolyses the silicon–oxygen parts of \nthe polymer chain, which form cross-linkages between \neach other. This effectively bonds the polymer chains \nto each other with strong covalent bonds. The cross-\nlinking siloxane grouping is \n  Si     O     Si  \n , which is \nthe equivalent of an ether functional group in carbon \nchemistry (see Figure 28.23).\n2RSi(OCH3)2R’  +  H2O → [RSi(OCH3)R’]2O  +  2CH3OH\n\n---\n\nS\ncross-linking\nbetween polymer chains\nS\nCH\nS\nS\nCH2\nCH2\nCH\nCH2\nCH2\nCH\nCH\nCH\nCH\nCH2\nCH\nS\nOCH3\n423\nSi\nOCH3\nH2O+\nOCH3\nSi\nhydrolysis\nOCH3\nSi\nsiloxane\ncross-linkage\nO\n+2CH3OH\nSi\nOCH3\nFigure 28.23  This shows how hydrolysis of a Si   O   CH3 \ngrouping can form a siloxane cross-link between polymer \nchains. As an adhesive sets (cures) many of these strong \ncovalent links will be formed to produce a giant network.\nThe polymers are called ‘silyl modified polymers’ (SMPs) \nand are non-toxic and environmentally friendly, and they \nset quickly. They perform well with most materials under a \nwide range of conditions (see Figure 28.24).\n\nFigure 28.24  Silyl modified polymers (SMPs) are a safer \noption than traditional adhesives, which use potentially \nharmful organic solvents.\nPolymers that form extensive networks of covalent \ncross-links are called thermosets.

          "content": "Degradable polymers\nChemists are now developing degradable plastics \nthat break down when they are discarded. The use \nof degradable plastics is becoming more common as \npeople start to realise the issues related to the disposal \nof polyalkenes as a result of their non-biodegradability \ncaused by their lack of reactivity (see page 212). Here are \ntwo developments to help solve the disposal problem: \nbiodegradable plastics and photodegradable plastics.\nBiodegradable plastics\nSome plastics, when buried for many years, eventually \nbecome brittle and break down into smaller pieces that can \nbe decomposed naturally by microorganisms in soil. If the \nsurface area of the plastic being buried could be increased, \nthen it could degrade much more quickly. Scientists have \ndeveloped plastics that contain small amounts of starch \ngranules that the bacteria and fungi in moist soil can break \ndown. So the plastic is broken into smaller pieces, with \na larger surface area for decomposition to occur faster. \nOther plastics are now made from monomers derived \ndirectly from plant materials, such as PLA, which soil \nmicroorganisms can digest easily (Figure 28.27).\nIn polyamides, such as nylon, the amide links, \n  CO     NH    , can be broken down by hydrolysis in \nacidic conditions found in land-fill waste dumps with \nrotting vegetation. You can see the hydrolysis reaction \non page 406, in which carboxylic acids and amines \nare formed.\nIn polyesters, the ester links are similarly broken down \nby acid hydrolysis, forming alcohols and carboxylic acids \n\n---\n\nFigure 28.27  Chemists are devising plastics that can be \nbroken down by microorganisms in soil or by light.\n(see page 229). This susceptibility to hydrolysis makes both \npolyamides and polyesters biodegradable, unlike the non-\nbiodegradable polyalkenes.\nPhotodegradable plastics\nPolymer chains also have been designed that incorporate \ncarbonyl groups (C     O) at intervals down their length. \nThese carbonyl groups absorb energy from the ultraviolet \nregion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This causes the \nbonds in the region of the carbonyl group to weaken \nand break down. As the polymer breaks into smaller \nfragments, the plastic will biodegrade much more quickly \nif it is not chemically inert.\nThere is some debate as to whether photodegradable \nplastics are better for the environment or not. In a land-\nfill site, the plastic waste is often buried under other \nrubbish and eventually soil – so there is no light available \nto trigger the breakdown of the polymer chains. They also \nmake recycling plastics problematic, as they could weaken \na recycled mixture of different plastics when it is put to a \nnew use.\n425\nConducting polymers\nMost polymers are electrical insulators, which makes them \nvery useful for making plugs, sockets and light switches. \nHowever, a group of polymers have been developed that \ncan conduct electricity. One of the first was the polymer \nformed from the hydrocarbon called ethyne (also still \nknow by its old name, acetylene). Its molecular formula is \nC2H2 and its displayed formula is:\nH    C     C  \n H",

These two \nfunctional groups can be in the same molecule, as in \nthe case of poly(lactic acid) on page 421, or at either \nend of two different monomers, as in nylon 6,6 on \npage 413.

Nylon 6 is \nformed by heating caprolactam, which is produced \nfrom 6-aminohexanoic acid in a condensation \nreaction. The numbers in the name of a particular \nnylon refer to the number of carbon atoms in the \nmonomers.\n■\t Condensation polymerisation between the amino \nand carboxylic acid groups in amino acids produces \na polypeptide or protein. The amide links in these \npolymers are known as peptide links (also known as \npeptide bonds).\n■\t The polyester called terylene® is formed by \ncondensation polymerisation of benzene-1,4-\ndicarboxylic acid with ethane-1,2-diol. H2O is also \nproduced in the reaction.\n■\t There are 20 different amino acids used by cells to \nbuild proteins.\n\n■\t The amino acids found in proteins contain a \ncarboxylic acid, an amino group and a side-chain \n(represented by R) all attached to the same \ncarbon atom. They have the general formula \nNH2CH(R)COOH.\n■\t The R groups may be classified as polar or non-polar, \nand as acidic, basic or neutral.\n■\t The primary structure of a protein chain is the \nsequence of amino acids in the chain.\n■\t The secondary structure of a protein arises from the \nfolding of the polypeptide backbone into α-helices or \nβ-pleated sheets and their stabilisation by hydrogen \nbonding between N   H and C   O groups in different \npeptide bonds.\n■\t The tertiary structure of a protein arises from \nfurther folding of the secondary structure and its \nstabilisation by bonds and intermolecular forces \nbetween the R groups (disulfide bonds, ionic bonds, \nhydrogen bonds and van der Waals’ forces).\n■\t The functioning of proteins depends on their three-\ndimensional structure (which is determined by their \namino acid sequence).\n■\t Proteins and polypeptides can be hydrolysed by \nrefluxing in a strong acid, such as HCl(aq), forming \n2-amino-carboxylic acids.\n■\t Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a condensation \npolymer consisting of:\n–\t two chains of sugar–phosphate backbone (the \nsugar is deoxyribose)\n–\t nitrogen-containing bases attached to each \nsugar; the bases are adenine (A), guanine (G), \ncytosine (C) and thymine (T).\n■\t The two sugar–phosphate chains run in opposite \ndirections (they are anti-parallel) with the two chains \ntwisted round each other to form a double helix.\n\n---\n\n■\t Pairs of bases (complementary pairs) are stacked \nat right angles to the long axis of the helix. A always \npairs with T and C always pairs with G by hydrogen \nbonding. This helps stabilise the helix.\n■\t DNA produces new copies of itself during cell \ndivision. This is called replication.\n■\t When DNA replicates itself identical copies of the \nbase sequence are produced. After cell division the \nnew DNA molecules consist of one parent DNA strand \nand one ‘new’ strand.\n■\t Complementary base pairing is the molecular basis \nfor DNA replication.\n■\t DNA carries the genetic information for the \nproduction of proteins. Each gene stores the \ninformation for a polypeptide chain.\n■\t Poly(alkene)s are chemically inert and therefore non-\nbiodegradable. The van der Waals’ forces between \ntheir polymer chains depend on the reaction \nconditions chosen, which can affect chain length and \nextent of branching. The longer the polymer chains \nand the less branching, the stronger the van der \nWaals’ forces – increasing the strength and melting \ntemperature of the plastic.\n429\n■\t Polyesters and polyamides are biodegradable by \nacid hydrolysis and by the action of light, breaking \ntheir ester or amide links between their monomers in \nthe polymer chains.\n■\t Chemists have designed polymers to act as non-\nsolvent-based adhesives, for example epoxy resins \nand superglues, as well as conducting polymers, for \nexample poly(ethyne) – also known as polyacetylene.\n\nEnd-of-chapter questions\n1 a Explain the term condensation polymer. \n[2]\n b Kevlar is a condensation polymer that is used for making bullet-proof vests.

The \ninstruments used are often very sensitive, so \nchemical substances can be detected at very \nlow concentrations.\nFigure 29.1  Instrumental analysis can quickly detect tiny \ntraces of banned substances in a urine sample taken from \nan athlete during random testing. These checks are used to \nmonitor many sportspeople around the world and ensure that \ncompetition is fair on the sportsfield.\nChromatography\nPaper chromatography\nYou will be familiar with the technique of paper \nchromatography. It is used to separate mixtures as a \nsolvent moves up a piece of absorbent paper. We call the \nsolvent the mobile phase, and water trapped between the \ncellulose fibres of the paper is the stationary phase. The \nsubstances in the mixture will have different affinities for \nthe solvent and for the water, and so they move at different \nrates over the paper (Figure 29.2).\n434\na\nb\npaper clip\npaper\nglass tank\nsolvent\nsample to be\nseparated\npure reference\ncompounds\nFigure 29.2  a  Paper chromatography. b  The chromatogram produced. Components of the mixture can be identified by \ncomparison with pure reference compounds or by calculating Rf values (see Figure 29.3) and comparing these values with those in \ntables of data.\n\n---\n\nThe Rf values (retardation factors) of substances are \ncalculated as shown in Figure 29.3. The conditions must be \nidentical to those quoted in the Rf data table, e.g. the same \ntemperature and the same solvent used.\nColoured substances can be seen directly on the \npaper but others are sprayed with a chemical that \nforms coloured compounds on the chromatogram. For \nexample, amino acids can be revealed as bluish spots by \nninhydrin spray.\nsupporting rod \nsolvent front\npure reference\ncompounds\nmixture of solutes\nto be identified\n\nsolvent front\ny\nRf value is x\ny\nx\ncompound started here\nFigure 29.3  How to calculate Rf values, which are \nthen compared with reference values obtained under \nidentical conditions.\nTwo-way chromatography\nSometimes two or more components in a mixture can \nhave similar Rf values in a particular solvent. This means \nthat their spots on the paper chromatogram will overlap \nand separation will be poor. This can happen when we \nhydrolyse a protein and try to identify the amino acid \nresidues present. This is when two-way chromatography is \nuseful. In this technique, paper chromatography is carried \nout as normal but then the chromatogram produced \nis rotated by 90° and re-run in a different solvent. It is \nunlikely that the Rf values will coincide in two different \nsolvents, so separation takes place (Figure 29.4).\nMaking a two-way paper chromatogram\n1st solvent front\n2nd solvent front\n2nd solvent front\ntwo solutes\noverlapping\n1st solvent front\nrotate paper\nthrough 90°\nthree solutes now\ncompletely separated\noriginal\nmixture\nmixture of\nthree solutes\nFigure 29.4  Two-way paper chromatography to separate \nsolutes with similar Rf values in a solvent. The technique \ncan also be used with thin-layer chromatography (see \npage 436).\n\n---\n\nPartition coefficients in chromatography\nThe principle of partition of a solute between two solvents \n(see page 319) helps us to understand more fully how the \ncomponents in a mixture are separated in chromatography. \nIn paper chromatography the different partition \ncoefficients of the components in a mixture correspond to \ntheir relative solubilities in the two solvents. The mobile \nphase is the solvent chosen. The other solvent is the water \ntrapped in the paper’s structure, which is the stationary \nphase. Figure 29.5 shows solute molecules partitioned \nbetween the mobile phase and a stationary liquid phase on \na solid support.\nThe solutes in the mixture being separated are \npartitioned to different extents between the solvents \nin the mobile and stationary phases. The greater the relative \nsolubility in the mobile phase, the faster the \nrate of movement as the mobile phase passes over the \nstationary phase.\nsolute molecules\ndissolved in the\nstationary liquid phase\nstationary\nliquid phase\n435\nsolid support\nFigure 29.5  Partition chromatography. The mobile phase \nmoves over the stationary liquid phase, carrying solute \nparticles with it.

The mobile phase \nmoves over the stationary solid phase.\nThe solid stationary phase is usually alumina (Al2O3) or \nsilica (SiO2), which is made into a slurry with water and \nspread onto a microscope slide. This is then put into an \noven, where it dries out into a solid white coating on the \nglass. A chromatogram is then made in a similar way to \npaper chromatography (Figure 29.7).\nMaking a thin-layer chromatogram\n436\nlid\nthin layer of\nSiO2 or Al2O3\ncoated onto a\nglass or plastic\nsurface \nmixture of\nsolutes\nsolvent\nFigure 29.7  Thin-layer chromatography.\nPolar molecules have a greater attraction for a polar solid \nused as the stationary phase, and they are adsorbed more \nstrongly onto its surface. Therefore they travel more slowly \nup the thin layer of alumina or silica, and separation \noccurs. Solutes are located on the chromatogram and \nidentified by comparing with standard known substances \nor by calculating Rf values.\n\n---\n\nNote that although TLC is normally described as \nadsorption chromatography, some partitioning does \noccur if water is present. Both dried alumina and silica \ncan become rehydrated. When this happens, water also \nacts as a partitioning stationary phase together with the \nadsorbing stationary solid phase.\nTLC is quicker than paper chromatography and \ncan be used on smaller samples, making it useful in \nforensic science, where it can be used to identify drugs \nand explosive residues. For example, TLC is used for \nthe analysis of a substance that is suspected to be \ncannabis. The stationary phase is silica sprayed with \nsilver nitrate solution, which is then dried. The mobile \nphase is methylbenzene.\nquestion\n2\t \u0007a\t \u0007TLC can separate mixtures of components. What \ndo we call the mechanism of separation usually at \nwork in TLC?\n\u0007b\t \u0007A mixture of propanone and hexane was separated \non a TLC chromatogram using alumina as the \nstationary phase and methylbenzene as the \nsolvent. Which substance would you expect to rise \nfurther up the chromatogram? Explain why.\nHigh-performance liquid \nchromatography\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography, referred to \nas HPLC, uses partitioning to separate and identify the \ncomponents in a mixture. The stationary phase is a non-\nvolatile liquid, such as a long-chain hydrocarbon liquid, \nbonded onto a solid support, e.g. small particles of silica. \nThis is packed tightly into a column. The solvent chosen \nfor the mobile phase is usually polar, e.g. a methanol/water \nsolvent. This has to be forced under pressure through \nthe densely packed column where separation occurs \n(Figure 29.8).\nThe tiny solid particles in the column have a very large \nsurface area over which partitioning can occur, resulting \nin excellent separation. The more polar components in \nthe mixture have a greater relative solubility in the polar \nsolvent. Therefore they are carried through the column \nfaster than components whose molecules are more non-\npolar (which dissolve better in the non-polar stationary \nphase in the column).

          "content": "Proton (1H) nuclear magnetic \nresonance\nHow NMR works\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a \nwidely used analytical technique for organic compounds. \nNMR is based on the fact that the nucleus of each \nhydrogen atom in an organic molecule behaves like a tiny \nmagnet. The nucleus of a hydrogen atom consists of a \nsingle proton. This proton can spin. The spinning motion \nof the positively charged proton causes a very small \nmagnetic field to be set up.\nIn NMR we put the sample to be analysed in a \nmagnetic field. The hydrogen nuclei (protons) either line \nup with the field or, by spinning in the opposite direction, \nline up against it (Figure 29.13).\nThere is a tiny difference in energy between the \noppositely spinning 1H nuclei. This difference corresponds \nto the energy carried by waves in the radiowave range \nof the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. In NMR \nspectroscopy the nuclei ‘flip’ between the two energy \nlevels (Figure 29.14). Only atoms whose mass number is an \nodd number, e.g. 1H or 13C, absorb energy in the range of \nfrequencies that are analysed.\nThe size of the gap between the nuclear energy levels \nvaries slightly, depending on the other atoms in the \nmolecule (the molecular environment). Therefore, NMR \ncan be used to identify 1H atoms in different parts of \na molecule. This is easier to visualise by looking at an \nexample. If we look at a molecule of methanol, CH3OH, we \ncan see that there are 1H atoms in two different molecular \nenvironments. We have the 1H atoms in the  CH3 group \nand the 1H atom in the  OH group. The energy absorbed \nby the  CH3 1H atoms is different from the energy \nabsorbed by the 1H atoms in  OH.\nIn NMR spectroscopy, we vary the magnetic field as \nthat is easier than varying the wavelength of radiowaves. \nAs the magnetic field is varied, the 1H nuclei in different \nH\nnucleus\nH\nnucleus\nFigure 29.13  Hydrogen \n(1H) nuclei will line up \nwith or against an applied \nmagnetic field.\nthis nucleus\nis lined up with\nthe applied ﬁeld\n\n---\n\nthis small diﬀerence in energy\nlies in the radiowave range\n‘against’\nEnergy\nbefore ﬁeld\nis applied\nafter ﬁeld is applied\n‘with’\nFigure 29.14  Hydrogen (1H) nuclei will absorb energy in the \nradiowave range when they ‘flip’ from the lower energy level, \nlining up with the applied magnetic field, to the higher energy \nlevel, lining up against it.\nmolecular environments flip at different field strengths. \nThe different field strengths are measured relative to a \nreference compound, which is given a value of zero. The \nstandard compound chosen is tetramethylsilane (TMS). \nTMS is an inert, volatile liquid that mixes well with \nmost organic compounds. Its formula is Si(CH3)4, so all \nits H atoms are equivalent (i.e. they are all in the same \nmolecular environment). TMS only gives one, sharp \nabsorption, called a peak, and this peak is at a higher \nfrequency than most other protons (Figure 29.15). All \nother absorptions are measured by their shift away from \nthe TMS line on the NMR spectrum. This is called the \nchemical shift (δ), and is measured in units of parts per \nmillion (ppm).\n439\nsingle peak\nof TMS\n(which we use\nas a standard)\n0\nchemical\nshift (δ)\nFigure 29.15  The standard TMS peak used as a reference on \nNMR spectra.\ndirection of\nmagnetic ﬁeld\napplied in\nNMR spectrometer\nthis nucleus\nis lined up against\nthe applied ﬁeld\n\nquestion\n4\t \u0007a\t \u0007Explain why tetramethylsilane (TMS) is used as a \nstandard in NMR spectroscopy.\n\u0007b\t \u0007In NMR we use solvents such as \ntetrachloromethane to prepare samples for the \nmachine (Figure 29.16).\n440\nFigure 29.16  Samples dissolved in a solvent in narrow \ntubes ready for NMR analysis.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007What is the molecular formula of \ntetrachloromethane?\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007Why do you think tetrachloromethane is used \nas a solvent?\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007Solvents that contain deuterium, D, are also \nused as solvents in NMR. Deuterium is the \nisotope 2H. A substance in which 1H is \nreplaced by 2H is said to be deuterated. Why \nwould the deuterated solvent CDCl3 be used \ninstead of CHCl3?\n\n---\n\nLow-resolution NMR\nA low-resolution NMR spectrum shows a single peak for \neach non-equivalent hydrogen atom; an example is shown \nin Figure 29.17.\nNote how the zero point on the x-axis, chemical shift \n(δ), is on the right of the spectrum and the shift increases \nin value going left.\nThere are three peaks on ethanol’s low-resolution \nNMR spectrum. These correspond to the 1H atoms in \n OH,  CH2\n and  CH3. Note how the heights of the \npeaks vary. The area under each peak tells us the relative \nnumber of equivalent 1H atoms responsible for that \nparticular chemical shift. The largest peak will be from \nthe  CH3 hydrogen atoms, the middle peak from the \n CH2\n hydrogen atoms and the smallest peak from the \n OH hydrogen. The relative areas under the peaks are \nshown on the NMR spectrum by the labels 1H, 2H and 3H \n(Figure 29.17).\nThe type of H atom present can be checked against \ntables of data (Table 29.1) if you are using NMR to identify \nunknown organic compounds.\nUsing Table 29.1 we can see that the peak at about 1.2 ppm \nis caused by the   CH3 hydrogen atoms (range 0.7–1.6 ppm), \nthe peak at about 3.7 ppm corresponds to   CH2 hydrogen \natoms (range 3.3–4.3 ppm) and the peak at about 5.4 ppm is \ndue to the   OH hydrogen atom.\n3H\nAbsorption of energy\n2H\n1H\nδ/ ppm\n7.0\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\nFigure 29.17  The low-resolution NMR spectrum of \nethanol, CH3CH2OH.\n\nType of proton\nChemical shift, δ / ppm\nR   CH3\n0.7–1.6\nN   H\t\nR   OH\n1.0–5.5(a)\nR   CH2   R\n1.2–1.4\nR3CH\n1.6–2.0\nO\nRCH2\nC\nO\nH3C\nC\nCH2R\nCH3\t\nN   CH3\t\nN   CH2R\t\nN   CHR2\n2.3–2.9\nO   CH3\t\nO   CH2R\t\nO   CHR2\n3.3–4.3\nBr or Cl   CH3\t\nBr or Cl   CH2R\t\nBr or Cl   CHR2\n3.0–4.2\n   CH   CH   \n45.–6.0\nO\nC\nNH2\t\nO\nO\nH\nC\n9.0–10\nO\nH\nC\n11.0–12.0(a)\nquestion\n5\t \u0007Predict the number of peaks and the relative areas \nunder each peak, where appropriate, on the low-\nresolution proton NMR spectrum of:\n\u0007a\t \u0007methanol, CH3OH\t\n\u0007d\t\n\u0007propan-1-ol\n\u0007b\t \u0007benzene, C6H6\t\n\u0007e\t\n\u0007propan-2-ol\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007chloroethane, C2H5Cl\t\n\u0007f\t\n\u0007propanone.\n\n---\n\nO\nR2CH\nC\n2.0–2.9\nCHR2\n2.3–2.7\nOH\n4.5–10.0(a)\nNH\nC\n5.0–12.0(a)\n441\nH\n6.5–8.0\nTable 29.1  1H NMR chemical shifts relative to TMS. Chemical shifts are typical values that can vary slightly depending on the \nsolvent, concentration and substituents. (a)OH and NH chemical shifts are very variable (sometimes outside these limits and are \noften broad. Signals are not usually seen as split peaks).\n\nThis interference is called spin–spin coupling. The exact \nsplitting pattern of a peak depends on the number of \nhydrogen atoms on the adjacent carbon atom or atoms.\nThe number of signals a peak splits into equals n + 1 \nwhere n is the number of 1H atoms on the adjacent \ncarbon atom.\nThe high-resolution NMR spectrum of ethanol illustrates this \nn + 1 rule used to interpret splitting patterns (Figure 29.18).\n■\n■\nThe    CH3 peak is split into three because there are two 1H \natoms on the adjacent CH2 group. n + 1 = 3 (as n = 2); this is \ncalled a triplet.\n■\n■\nThe    CH2\n peak is split into four because there are three \n1H atoms on the adjacent    CH3 group. n + 1 = 4 (as n = 3); \nthis is called a quartet.\n■\n■\nThe    OH peak is not usually split as its 1H atom is \nconstantly being exchanged with the 1H atoms of other \nethanol molecules and any water present.

The reason for this is \nthat the  OH proton exchanges very rapidly with protons \nin any traces of water (or acid) present, as follows:\n\nThe hydrogen atoms involved in this reversible proton \nexchange have been coloured red and blue. The exchange takes \nplace so rapidly that the signal for the    OH protons becomes \na single peak. This exchange also happens in amines and \namides which contain the  NH  group.\nTable 29.3 shows the chemical shift ranges for the \ndifferent    OH and \n NH  signals.\nDifferent OH and NH protons\nRange of chemical \nshift (δ) / ppm\nin alcohols, R   OH protons\n1.0–5.5 \nin phenols, arene   OH protons\n6.5–7.0 \nin carboxylic acids, R   COOH protons\n11.0–11.7 \nin amines,    NH2 /    NH    \n1.0–5.5 \nin aryl amines, arene    NH2 \n3.0–6.0\nin amides,    CONH2  ,    CONH   \n5.0–12.0\nTable 29.3  Chemical shift ranges for \n OH and \n NH  \nprotons in different molecular environments.\nAs you can see from Table 29.1 (page 441), these ranges \noverlap with the chemical shifts of other types of \nproton. The signals can also appear outside the quoted \nranges under certain conditions, e.g. choice of solvent \nor concentration. This makes NMR spectra difficult to \ninterpret. However, there is a technique for positively \nidentifying    OH or \n NH  groups in a molecule. \nTheir peaks ‘disappear’ from the spectra if you add a \nsmall amount of deuterium oxide, D2O, to the sample. \nThe deuterium atoms (2H) in D2O, called ‘heavy water’, \nexchange reversibly with the protons in the    OH or \n444\n NH  groups. For example:\n   OH  +  D2O \n OD  +  HOD\n   NH   CO     +  D2O \n ND   CO     +  HOD\nThe deuterium atoms do not absorb in the same region \nof the electromagnetic spectrum as protons (1H atoms). \nThis makes the  OH or NH signal disappear from the NMR \nspectrum. By checking against the peaks in the original NMR \nspectrum, without D2O, we can tell if the    OH or    NH    \ngroups are present in the sample. The 1H atom in the    OH or \n NH  group is referred to as a ‘labile’ proton.\n\n---\n\nquestion\n7\t \u0007a\t \u0007Look back to Figure 29.18 on page 442. The high-\nresolution NMR spectrum shown is from a sample \nof ethanol containing traces of water. How would \nthe NMR spectrum differ if D2O had been added to \nthe sample of ethanol?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Look back to Question 6. How would repeating \nthe NMR analysis using a solvent of D2O be able to \nhelp the pathologist distinguish between aspirin \nand paracetamol?\nCarbon-13 NMR spectroscopy\nIn addition to proton NMR. carbon-13 NMR is another \nanalytical tool used frequently by organic chemists. The \nvast majority of carbon atoms in any organic compound \nwill be the carbon-12 isotope. This isotope has an even \nmass number (12). Therefore it has no signal on an NMR \nspectrum, as NMR only works with atoms with an odd \nmass number (such as 1H, as we have already seen). \nHowever, about 1% of the carbon atoms in any sample of \nan organic compound will be the carbon-13 isotope. Its \nnuclei will interact with the magnetic field applied in NMR \nanalysis so can produce a NMR spectrum.\nCarbon-13 NMR produces a spectrum with different \nchemical shifts for non-equivalent carbon atoms in a \nmolecule. Typical carbon-13 NMR shifts are shown in \nTable 29.4. As in proton NMR, the chemical shifts are \nmeasured with reference to the TMS peak at 0 ppm on the \nspectrum (see page 439).\nAnalysis of carbon-13 NMR spectra is similar to that \nof proton NMR, looking to match different chemical shifts \nto characteristic molecular environments. However, the \nsignals produced in carbon-13 NMR appear as discrete \nvertical lines on the spectra (without the complication of \nthe splitting patterns caused by the protons in 1H atoms \nwithin the molecules). Take care in interpreting the \ncarbon-13 NMR spectra because the heights of the lines \nare not usually proportional to the number of equivalent \n13C atoms present.\nThe solvent used to prepare samples for 13C NMR \nanalysis is CDCl3.

          "content": "Mass spectrometry\nYou have already seen how a mass spectrometer \nworks (see page X). The mass spectrum of an element \ncan be used to measure relative isotopic masses and \ntheir relative abundances. This information is used to \ncalculate relative atomic masses. However, the main \nuse of mass spectrometry is in the identification of \norganic compounds. As in other forms of spectroscopy, \na substance can be identified by matching its spectrum \nagainst the spectra of known substances stored in a \ndatabase. This technique is known as ‘fingerprinting’.\nIn a mass spectrometer the sample is first vaporised. \nWhen vapour from the sample enters the machine it \nis bombarded by high-energy electrons. This knocks \nelectrons from the molecules and breaks covalent bonds, \nfragmenting the molecule. Figure 29.23 shows the mass \nspectrum produced by propanone.\n446\n100\n43\nRelative abundance (%)\n80\n60\n58\n40\n20\n15\n0\n20\n0\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMass-to-charge ratio (m/e)\nFigure 29.23  The mass spectrum of propanone.\n\n---\n\nThe peak at the highest mass-to-charge ratio is caused by \nthe molecular ion (M+). This ion is formed by the sample \nmolecule with one electron knocked out. It gives us the relative \nmolecular mass of the sample. We can assume the \nions detected carry a single positive charge, so the reading \non the horizontal axis gives us the mass. In the case of \npropanone, CH3COCH3, the molecular ion has a relative \nmass of 58.0. This corresponds to CH3COCH3\n+, with a mass \nof (3 × 12.0) + (1 × 16.0) + (6 × 1.0).\nWe also get large peaks at 15 and 43 on the mass \nspectrum. These peaks are due to fragments that are \nproduced when propanone molecules are broken apart \nby the electron bombardment. Knowing the structure \nof propanone we should be able to identify the fragment \nresponsible for each peak (Figure 29.24).\nFigure 29.24  The fragmentation of propanone: +CH3 causes \nthe peak at 15 and CH3C+O causes the peak at 43.\nThe electron bombardment has caused the C   C single \nbonds in the propanone molecules to break. This has \nresulted in the fragments at m/e 15 and 43 that are \nobserved in Figure 29.22. The breaking of single bonds, \nsuch as C    C, C   O or C   N, is the most common cause \nof fragmentation.\nquestion\n9\t \u0007Look at Figure 29.25 on page 447, which shows the \nmass spectrum of ethanol, C2H5OH.

In chromatography, the mobile \nphase moves the components of a mixture through \nor over the stationary phase.

          "content": "Designing new medicinal drugs\nHow do we go about designing new molecules to fight \ndiseases? One way is to identify the structural features the \nnew drug will need to stop particular bacteria or viruses \nworking. The structural features may be associated with \nthe active site on a particular enzyme needed for an \nessential function of the pathogen. Once these structural \nfeatures have been identified we can then predict the shape \nof a molecule that would fit into, and hence block, the \nactive site.\nThe functional groups present would also be crucial to \nensure the drug could bind into the active site effectively. \nThe intermolecular bonds formed between the drug and \nits target molecule could involve:\n■\n■\nhydrogen bonding\n■\n■\nionic attraction\n■\n■\ndipole–dipole forces\n■\n■\ninstantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces (van der Waals’ \nforces, see Chapter 4, page 62).\nComputers are now used to judge the fit between a \npotential drug molecule and a receptor site on its \ntarget molecule. Such molecular modelling has greatly \nspeeded up the process of designing new medicines. \nThe interactions and fit of a potential medicine with \na biological receptor molecule can be studied before \nthe medicine is ever made in the lab. Before molecular \nmodelling became available, the synthesis of a new \n\n---\n\nmedicine involved far more trial and error. Chemists had \nto prepare many more possible medicines for testing. \nWith molecular modelling, only those molecules that \nare definite possibilities are made and tested. Molecular \nmodelling on a computer is now a powerful tool, used \nwhen designing medicines and many other compounds \n(e.g. pesticides and polymers).\nThis type of research was used in the fight against \nAIDS in the late 1980s and 1990s. Scientists using \nX-ray crystallography (a method in which a sample is \nirradiated with X-rays and the pattern is analysed by \ncomputer) worked out the shape of HIV protease in \n1988 (Figure 30.2). This enzyme plays an important role \nwhen the virus becomes infectious. Researchers realised \nthat, if a molecule could be discovered that could block \nits active site, this might be one step on the route to \nfinding a cure for AIDS. Knowing the molecule that the \nenzyme worked on (its substrate), researchers were able \nconstruct similar molecules on the computer screen to fit \nthe active site.\nThe first attempts fitted perfectly, but were not water \nsoluble. This meant the drug could not be delivered to its \ntarget, the HIV protease. Eventually a soluble molecule \nthat would interfere with the enzyme was found. In less \nthan 8 years pharmaceutical companies had developed \nthree new anti-viral drugs for people with HIV/AIDS. \nThis would have taken about twice as long if the structure \nof HIV protease had not been determined. Traditional \n457\n\nactive site\nFigure 30.2  A symmetrical HIV protease molecule, with its \nactive site in the centre of the molecule. Knowing its structure \nmade the search for a drug to fight AIDS much quicker and \ncheaper than traditional trial-and-error methods.\ntrial-and-error methods involve the testing of many \nthousands of possible drugs.\nThe death rate from AIDS dropped significantly. \nHowever, the virus developed resistance to the new drugs \nas it mutated. So scientists now have to model the new \ndrug-resistant strains of the infection and are developing \nnew drugs to inhibit the mutant versions of HIV protease. \nThese inhibitors are one part of a cocktail of drugs that \ncan be used to treat the disease now.\n458\nIdentifying macromolecules\nNMR spectroscopy is also used extensively in finding \nout the structures of biological macromolecules such \nas proteins and nucleic acids. As well as identifying the \ndifferent types of 1H atoms present, more sophisticated \ndata can yield, for example, the distance between atoms in \nmacromolecules. Large amounts of data are collected and \nanalysed by computer programs to reveal the shape of the \nmolecules under investigation.\nFigures 30.3 and 30.4 show images obtained from \nNMR analysis of two protein molecules made up from \nover 100 amino acids. These are called ribbon diagrams.\n\n---\n\nFigure 30.4  A protein made up of 153 amino acid residues.\nThis NMR analysis takes place in solution, so it is \nparticularly useful for medical research. Many human \nproteins exist in solution in the body so we can mimic the \ninteractions that take place in cells or in the bloodstream.\nquestion\n1\t \u0007a\t \u0007Which method was used to determine the \nstructure of HIV protease in 1988?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Which method could be used to show the shape of \nthe enzyme in solution? \n\u0007c\t\n\u0007What type of natural polymer is an enzyme such as \nHIV protease?\n\u0007d\t \u0007How did the new anti-viral drugs work?\n\nused to treat the pain caused by arthritis (Figure 30.5). \nOne enantiomer will ease the pain but the other can cause \nliver damage.\nAs another example, one enantiomer of a drug used \nto treat tuberculosis (TB) is effective, whereas the \nother can cause blindness. Therefore, chemists ideally \nneed a single pure enantiomer to put in their drug \nproduct. Note that about 80% of new drugs patented are \nsingle enantiomers.\nUsing pure enantiomers will be beneficial as it:\n■\n■\nreduces the patient’s dosage by half as the pure enantiomer \nis more potent, i.e. has better therapeutic activity (thereby \ncutting costs of production)\n■\n■\nminimises the risk of side effects (thereby protecting \npatients from further problems and drugs companies \nfrom possible legal action for damages if serious side effects \ndo occur).\nThere are three ways to prepare pure enantiomers:\n■\n■\noptical resolution\n■\n■\nusing optically active starting materials\n■\n■\nusing a chiral catalyst.\nOptical resolution\nThis method involves the chemists following a traditional \nsynthetic route to make the compound, resulting in a \nracemic mixture. Then they separate the two enantiomers \nin a process called optical resolution. This involves using \na pure enantiomer of another optically active compound \n(called a chiral auxiliary) that will react with one of the \nisomers in the mixture. The new product formed will \nnow have different properties and so can be separated \nby physical means. For example, the solubility in a \ngiven solvent will differ so the unwanted enantiomer \nand the new product can be separated by fractional \ncrystallisation. The new product is then converted back \nto the desired enantiomer in a simple reaction (e.g. by \nadding dilute alkali).\nThe crystallisation is repeated many times to ensure \npurity. This method is difficult, time-consuming, uses \nextra reagents and involves the disposal of half the original \nracemic mixture.\nLarge volumes of organic solvents (often harmful \nto the environment) are used in the process. However, \nchemists are now using supercritical carbon dioxide as a \nsolvent, which is much safer. At 31 °C and 73 atmospheres \npressure, CO2 is a suitable non-polar solvent for many \ndrug derivatives in the racemic resolution process. The \nsolubility of the derivatives can be changed, simply by \nvarying the density of the solvent. The solvent, which is \n\n---\n\nnon-toxic, is easily removed by reducing the pressure and \nthen recycling it to use in the process again.\nWe can also use high-performance liquid \nchromatography (HPLC, see page 436) to separate a \nracemic mixture, as long as the stationary medium (e.g. \nthe solid that packs the column) is itself optically active.\nUsing optically active starting materials\nThis technique uses starting materials that are themselves \noptically active and in the same orientation as the desired \nproduct. These are often naturally occurring compounds \nsuch as carbohydrates or L-amino acids. The biochemist \nwill choose from this ‘chiral pool’. The synthetic route is \ndesigned to keep any intermediates and the final product \nformed in the same enantiomeric form. As a result, there is \nno need to carry out the costly separation process needed \nwhen a racemic mixture is produced.\nChiral catalysts\nChemists are also developing new chiral catalysts that \nensure only one specific enantiomer is formed in a \nreaction. The benefits of these catalysts are that only small \nquantities are needed and they can be used over and \nover again, although the catalyst itself can be expensive. \nA ruthenium (Ru) organometallic catalyst is used in the \nproduction of naproxen (see Figure 30.5).\nOften a combination of optical resolution and \nchiral synthesis is needed in the production of a \npharmaceutically active, pure enantiomer.\n459\nC\nH\nH\nC\nCOOH\n+ H2\nCH3O\norganometallic\nruthenium catalyst\n(a chiral catalyst)\n⎯⎯→\nCH3\nH\nC\n*\nCOOH\nCH3O\nnaproxen\n(drug for arthritis)\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry can also use enzymes to \npromote stereoselectivity and produce single-enantiomer \nproducts. The specific shape and the nature of the \nmolecular interactions at the active site of an enzyme \nensure only one enantiomer will be formed (as in living \nthings). The enzymes are often immobilised (fixed in \nplace) on inert supports. This enables the reactants to be \npassed over them without the need to separate the product \nfrom the enzymes after the reaction.\nHowever, it can be expensive isolating enzymes from living \nthings. Using whole organisms, such as bacteria, can reduce \nthis cost. Nowadays, synthetic enzymes can also be made, \ndesigned for a particular synthesis. Therefore a search for a \nsuitable enzyme from the limited pool available from natural \nsources is not always necessary.\nOverall, using an enzyme process might take longer \nto develop than a conventional synthetic route, but \nin the long run the benefits generally outweigh the \ndisadvantages. There are fewer steps needed in the \nsynthesis route, resulting in a ‘greener’ process.\nquestion\n460\n2\t \u0007a\t \u0007Why are pure enantiomers rather than \nracemic mixtures the better option for use as \npharmaceutical drugs from the point of view of:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007a patient\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007a pharmaceutical company?\nalkanes\nH2(g), heat\nunder pressure\nwith nickel\ncatalyst\nultraviolet\nlight with\nhalogen, room\ntemperature\nand pressure\nalkenes\ntreat with HX(aq),\nroom temperature\nand pressure\ndistil from mixture\nof alcohol, conc.\nH2SO4 and KX(s)\nheat with dilute\naqueous alkali\nhot pumice\nand AI2O3\npass alkene and\nsteam over heated\nphosphoric acid catalyst\nunder pressure\nwarm with NaBH4\nin water\nalcohols\n\n---\n\nquestion (continued)\n\u0007b\t \u0007Why are modern enzyme-based processes \nfor manufacturing pure enantiomers more \nsustainable (environmentally friendly) than \ntraditional synthetic routes used by the \npharmaceutical industry?\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Find out why the drug thalidomide resulted in legal \naction against its manufacturer.\nSynthetic routes\nWhen research chemists want to make a new compound, \nthey usually work backwards from the desired compound \nto create a series of reactions, starting with a compound \nextracted from a commonly available raw material. In \nindustry, common starting materials are hydrocarbons \nfrom crude oil and its refining, and compounds extracted \nfrom plants, such as esters from fats and vegetable oils.\nYou will need some of the skills of a research chemist \nwhen tackling questions that involve:\n■\n■\npredicting the reactions of complex molecules you \nhave never seen before, containing more than one \nfunctional group\n■\n■\nsuggesting a series of reactions to make a given compound \nfrom a given starting compound.\nIn order to be successful in answering these questions, \nyou will need to be familiar with all the reactions and \nconditions of each homologous series mentioned in the \nsyllabus. The flow chart in Figure 30.6 is a summary of \namines\nheat with\nalcohol\nand acid\ncatalyst\nheat under pressure\nwith ammonia in alcohol\nhalogenoalkanes\ncarboxylic acids\nesters\nheat with water\nand acid catalyst\nwarm with\nNaBH4 in\nwater\nreﬂux with excess\nacidiﬁed potassium\ndichromate(VI)\naldehydes\nheat with\nwater and\nacid catalyst\ndistil on adding to\nacidiﬁed potassium dichromate(VI)\n\nsome of the most useful reactions you need to know, \nbut you could be asked about others, so it is a good idea \nto make your own summary spider charts for all the \nreactions in Chapters 15 to 28. For example, for Chapter 16 \nwrite the word ‘Halogenoalkane’ in a box and draw arrows \nradiating out from the box to the products made in their \nreactions, labelling the arrows with other reactants and the \nreaction conditions. Displaying these on a wall and using \ndifferent colours will help you remember them.\nAdding carbon atoms\nSometimes the starting compound from a raw material \ndoes not have enough carbon atoms in its molecules to \nmake the desired product. An extra carbon atom can be \nadded by adding the nitrile functional group, \n C   N. \nRemember that these can be made from halogenoalkanes:\nreflux with ethanolic KCN\nRBr  +  HCN \n RCN  +  HBr\nwhere R is an alkyl group, so RCN has an extra \ncarbon atom.\nquestion\n3\t \u0007a\t \u0007Name the functional groups in the molecules of:\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007aspirin\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007paracetamol.\nO\nH\nO\nC\nH\nH\nH\nO\nN\nO\nH\nC\nC\nH\nO\nC\nC\nH\naspirin\nparacetamol\nH\nO\nH\n\u0007b\t \u0007i\t\n\u0007Both the molecules in part a are broken down \nwhen refluxed with dilute hydrochloric acid.

Generally, only one \nof the enantiomers of a drug is beneficial to living \norganisms and the other isomer may have undesirable \neffects. The beneficial isomer has the appropriate \nshape and pattern of intermolecular forces to interact \nwith a receptor molecule in a living organism.\n■ Chemists are now producing drugs containing \nsingle enantiomers rather than a racemic mixture \nof isomers. This enables the dose to be halved, \nimproves pharmacological activity (behaviour of \nmolecule in an organism), reduces side effects and \nminimises litigation against manufacturers.\nEnd-of-chapter questions\n1 A sample of lactic acid (CH3CH(OH)COOH) was extracted from a natural source and found to be optically active.

This will remind you of the structure of \ninvestigations – which is essential to understand before \nyou can apply the higher-order practical skills tested in \nPaper 5.\nPlanning\nExpectations\nYou should be able to:\nDefining the problem\n■\n■\nidentify the independent variable in the experiment \nor investigation\n■\n■\nidentify the dependent variable in the experiment \nor investigation\n■\n■\nformulate the aim in terms of a prediction or hypothesis, \nand express this in words or in the form of a predicted graph\n\n---\n\nMethods\n■\n■\ndescribe the method to be used to vary the independent \nvariable, and the means that you propose to ensure that you \nhave measured its values accurately\n■\n■\ndescribe how you will measure the dependent variable\n465\n■\n■\ndescribe how you will control each of the other \nkey variables\n■\n■\nexplain how you will use any control experiments to verify \nthat it is the independent variable that is affecting the \ndependent variable and not some other factor\n■\n■\ndescribe the arrangement of apparatus and the steps in the \nprocedure to be followed\n■\n■\nsuggest appropriate volumes and concentrations \nof reagents\n■\n■\nassess the risks of your proposed methods\n■\n■\ndescribe precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a \nminimum\n■\n■\ndraw up tables for data that you might wish to record\n■\n■\ndescribe how the data might be used in order to reach a \nconclusion.\nAs the expectations above show, all plans contain two \ndistinct sections:\n■\n■\ndefining the problem – this is worth 4 marks\n■\n■\nthe actual method – this is worth a further 8 marks.\n\nAlmost invariably, a prediction is required together \nwith an explanation of the basis of the prediction, forming \na hypothesis to test. For example, in a question about rate \nof reaction, you might make a quantitative prediction, \nsuch as the direct proportionality between the rate \nand concentration. Here, the supporting explanation \nwould need to be given in terms of the doubling of the \nfrequency of particle collisions as a result of doubling the \nconcentration. The planning question might also ask for a \nsupporting graph to be given.\nYou will have to specify the independent and the \ndependent variables. You might also have to consider the \nneed to control other variables.\nIn a ‘rate’ exercise, the independent variable might be \nthe concentration of a reactant or the temperature. The \nmeasured rate of the reaction at different values of the \nindependent variable is the dependent variable. Alternative \nways of measuring the rate of reaction, such as the time \nto collect a set volume of gas (giving average rates) or the \nmonitoring of gas released over time (then calculating the \ninitial gradient of lines on a graph to measure initial rates), \nare acceptable.\nMethods\nWhen creating a method, you should produce one that can \nbe followed by another student without the need to ask any \nextra questions. This means that fine detail is required and \nnothing should be omitted on the basis that it is ‘obvious’.\nThe question might provide further information \nthat builds on the stem, but you are expected to have \nexperience of basic laboratory apparatus. The best way \nto achieve this is to follow a programme of experimental \nwork throughout the course. This also has the advantage of \npromoting the understanding of concepts underlying the \npractical work.\nBasic techniques, such as titrations, standard solution \nproduction and rate measurement, should be thoroughly \nunderstood in detail. You also need to be aware of the \nvarious methods of measuring volume and mass available \nin a laboratory. For example, an experiment involving the \nproduction and collection of a gas, such as the effect of \nheat on nitrates, would require you to be aware that gas \nsyringes usually have a maximum capacity of 100 cm3 and \nthat the alternative of collecting the gas over water in a \nburette would allow for the collection of only 50 cm3. This \nexample shows how it is important to perform meaningful \npractical work in order to prepare for Paper 5. There is no \nsubstitute for familiarity in handling real apparatus.\nOn occasion, a diagram of the apparatus to be used \nis requested and you need to be able to represent the \n466\n\n---\n\napparatus in a simple and understandable format. It \nis essential that each piece of equipment can be easily \nrecognised in the diagram. Practice drawing sessions are a \nvery good idea.\nRelevant calculations are an almost routine \nrequirement, and these must be logically presented, step \nby step.\nThe preparation of a standard solution of a solid acid, \nsuch as ethanedioic acid, requires the calculation of the \nmass to be dissolved in a chosen volumetric flask in order \nto produce the required concentration. The described \nprocedure should indicate that the solid needs to be \ndissolved completely in distilled water before adding the \nsolution to the volumetric flask (see Figure P2.2). You \nshould make clear how you can ensure that all of this \nsolution is transferred successfully to the volumetric \nflask – for example, by rinsing any solution stuck on the \ninside of the original container into the volumetric flask \nusing distilled water. Once in the volumetric flask, the \nsolution is made up to the required mark, and must then \nbe thoroughly mixed.\nYou are expected to calculate the amounts of substance \nused to suit the volume or size of the apparatus that you \nspecify. For example, if the plan involves collecting a gas \nfrom the decomposition of a carbonate in a 100 cm3 gas \nsyringe, the calculated mass of the solid heated should be \nsuch as to produce slightly less than 100 cm3 of the gas.\nFigure P2.2  Volumetric flasks are used to make up standard \nsolutions of known concentration accurately.\n\nAn integral part of any plan is the collection and \npresentation of results. Any processing of the results \nmust be specified, and the figures obtained should also be \npresented as the ‘derived results’. The derived results may \nthen be processed in order to confirm or deny (falsify) \nthe original prediction or hypothesis. This processing \nmay involve calculating means of repeat readings and the \ngraphical presentation of results.\nThe recorded results are those collected from the \nvarious steps taken in carrying out the procedure. For \nexample, in an exercise to find the enthalpies of solution of \nGroup 1 hydroxides, the necessary results columns to be \nrecorded are:\n■\n■\nthe name or nature of the hydroxide\n■\n■\nthe mass of a weighing bottle\n■\n■\nthe mass of the weighing bottle and a sample of the hydroxide\n■\n■\nthe initial temperature of the water\n■\n■\nthe final temperature of the solution.\nIf you plan to repeat any tests to get replicate results, extra \ncolumns must be incorporated into the results table. Each \ncolumn should have the correct units – represented as \neither ‘/ g’ or ‘(g)’ for any mass, for example.\nThe next stage is to process the results:\n1\t to calculate the mass of hydroxide used\n2\t to calculate the number of moles of hydroxide used\n3\t to calculate the number of joules of energy released \ninto the solution\n4\t to use the results to parts 2 and 3 to deduce the \nstandard enthalpy change per mole of hydroxide.\nAll plans have to be assessed for risk. Examination \nquestions can ask for:\n■\n■\nan assessment of the risks involved in a particular \nexperiment\n■\n■\nhow to deal with the risks\n■\n■\nboth of the above.\nIn an exercise to determine the enthalpy of neutralisation \nof hydrochloric acid (the question will tell you that this is \n‘harmful’) and sodium hydroxide (which is ‘corrosive’), \nyou could be asked about a suitable precaution. \nAlternatively, an experiment on solubility may have hot \nwater as a possible hazard or if a toxic gas is formed, as in \nthe decomposition of Group 2 nitrates, the investigation \nshould be carried out in a fume hood.\nPoints to remember\n\n---\n\npaper before writing a bullet pointed list or flow chart that \nexplains exactly how you would carry out the investigation. \nThese could include diagrams of assembled apparatus that \ncan save complicated written explanations of the set-up.\n■\n■\nWhen describing how to vary your independent variable, \nensure you consider how to measure its values accurately. \nFor example, in a rate of precipitation investigation, when \nvarying the concentration of a solution you might choose \nto measure volumes of water and solution using \nvolumetric pipettes and fillers rather than just using a \nmeasuring cylinder (see Figure P2.3). You should also be \nfamiliar with the volumes and masses of reagents that are \nreasonable to use in normal everyday laboratory work. For \nexample, a volume of 15 cm3 of solution would be suitable \nfor an experiment in a boiling tube but not in a 250 cm3 \nconical flask.\n■\n■\nWhen deciding how to measure the dependent variable, you \nshould also consider accuracy – how you intend to measure \nits ‘true’ value. In a rate of precipitation investigation you \nmight choose to carry out the reaction in a conical flask on \ntop of a piece of paper with a pencil mark drawn on it. You \ncould then time how long it takes for the pencil mark to be \nno longer visible when viewed from above the flask. This \nwill involve a subjective judgement by the observer. If you \nhave done an experiment like this before, you will know \njust how difficult it is to decide the exact moment when \nyou can no longer see through the solution. So including a \n467",

You \nshould also revise the equivalent section in Chapter P1 \non pages 251–253 before reading the following advice.\nDealing with data\nIn a written practical paper, typically you will be presented \nwith some data, usually in a table, derived from an \nexperiment. The details of the experiment are given to \nyou, and then you will be asked to process the data and \nproduce a system that incorporates all the results and \nallows not only correct patterns to become apparent but \nalso detects anomalous results. The tabulated results will \nbe the measured quantities of the processes carried out in \na laboratory.\nFor example, in an experiment to confirm the formula \nof zinc iodide by reacting excess zinc with iodine, the \nmeasurements would be:\n■\n■\nmass of an empty test tube\n■\n■\nmass of the test tube and zinc powder\n■\n■\nmass of the test tube, zinc powder and iodine\n■\n■\nmass of the test tube and excess of zinc.\nFrom these you would calculate:\n■\n■\nthe mass of zinc used\n■\n■\nthe mass of iodine that reacted with that mass of zinc.\n\nas a curve or straight line. This line may not pass through \nall, or indeed any, of the plotted points. As a rough guide, \nan equal number of points should lie on the left of the line \nand on the right of the line, producing an ‘average’ line.\nEvaluation\nThe evaluation of a set of results can be approached in a \nnumber of ways. The aim of any experiment is to draw an \nappropriate conclusion, either to verify a relationship or \nto establish a new relationship. This is accomplished by \nlooking at the nature of the results and the quality of the \nexperiment itself.\nWhen anomalous results are identified, they should \nbe clearly labelled as such. The source of the anomaly will \noften need to be identified and will usually fall into one \nof two categories: either a positive or a negative deviation \nfrom the general trend.\nIn a reaction involving the reduction of a metal oxide, \nthe anomaly might arise because the reduction was \nincomplete, leading to a larger than expected mass of \nmetal. The excess mass is the unreacted oxide.\nIf the reaction involves the thermal decomposition of \nhydrated iron(II) sulfate two, opposite, errors are possible:\n■\n■\ninsufficient heating – this will cause the residual mass to be \ntoo great\n469\n■\n■\noverheating – this will cause the residual mass to be \ntoo small.\nThe former result corresponds to the incomplete removal \nof the water of crystallisation, whereas the latter relates to \nthe decomposition of the iron(II) sulfate into iron oxide.\nYou may be called upon to consider whether the \nactual experiment data under consideration is of high \nenough quality to produce reliable results, and appropriate \nimprovements may be requested. If the results provide poor \nsupport for a conclusion, it may be that further repeats are \nneeded, or that the range of results needs to be extended.\nApparatus may need to considered from two viewpoints:\n■\n■\nis it appropriate?\n■\n■\nis it accurate?\n\nerror of the temperature change will be greater than that \nof the measuring cylinder.\nThe volumes measured during titrations are about \nas accurate as simple exercises can be. If these are \ninvolved in an experiment the source of any error is likely \nto be elsewhere.\nMeasuring small volumes or masses generally \nproduces high percentage errors, whichever item of \nsimple laboratory apparatus is used. As an example, an \nexperiment to investigate the rate of reaction between \nhydrochloric acid and magnesium by measuring the \nvolume of hydrogen produced requires less than 0.10 g \nof magnesium if the gas produced is to be collected in a \n100 cm3 syringe. This is a very small mass of magnesium. \nUsing a typical balance accurate to 0.01 g would give a 10% \nerror and consequently the accuracy of the syringe is of \nnegligible significance. The error in measuring the mass of \nthe magnesium will be the greatest percentage error.\nConclusions\nThe conclusion of an exercise draws upon the key features \nof data collected and the subsequent analyses. Usually the \ndata given will support a given hypothesis. However, it \nmust be clearly understood that data that do not support \nan initial suggestion might also have to be considered.\nIn the magnesium/acid reaction, processing could \ninvolve plotting a graph of rate against the relative \nconcentration of the acid. Inspection of the graph would \nallow a deduction to be made about the order with respect \n470\nquestion\n2\t \u0007a\t \u0007In the experiment described in Question 1 on page \n468, a student weighed a mass of 11.35 g of the oxide \nof copper on a balance reading to the nearest 0.05 g. \nWhat was the percentage error in this measurement?\n\u0007b\t \u0007Another group of students carrying out the same \nexperiment found that their sample of the oxide of \ncopper contained 13.24 g of copper and 3.26 g of \noxygen. What is the most likely formula of the oxide of \ncopper? (Relative atomic mass of \nCu = 63.5; O = 16.0.)\n\n---\n\nto [H+] in the rate equation. This conclusion would then \nbe considered in the light of an original hypothesis. This, \nin turn, could lead to further predictions and experiments \n(see page 253 in Chapter P1). \nIf the experiment is considered to be too approximate, \nsuggested improvements to the exercise might be requested.\nPoints to remember\n■\n■\nCalculations involving data collected may ask for the mean, \nmedian, mode, percentage loss or percentage gain.\n■\n■\nTo calculate the mean, add up the individual values in a set \nand divide by the number of values. Take care not to quote \nthe mean to an unrealistic number of significant figures – \nthe mean should reflect the precision of the measurements \nfrom which it was calculated.\n■\n■\nThe median is the middle result when all the results are put \nin order of magnitude.\n■\n■\nThe mode is the most common value.\n■\n■\nPercentage loss or gain is calculated by dividing the actual \nloss or gain by the original value, then multiplying by 100.\n■\n■\nThe interval of the independent variable can be consistent \nwhen planning an investigation, but additional values can \nbe selected to look more closely where a pattern seems \nto change (e.g. the gradient of a line changes on a graph \nof your results) or to extend the limits of your original \nrange below its minimum value or above its maximum \nvalue. For example, you might decide to test a much lower \ndilution of 0.01 mol dm–3 when investigating the effect of \nconcentration on the rate of reaction. This would enable \nyou to test if the trend seen within your original range of \ndata continues as expected.\n\u0007c\t\n\u0007Nine out of the ten groups who tackled the experiment \nobtained results consistent with those of the group \ndescribed in part b. The other group’s measurements \nresulted in a ratio that suggested the formula of the \noxide was Cu2O.\n\u0007\t\n\u0007i\t\n\u0007What do we call their result when plotted on a class \ngraph of moles of oxygen against moles of copper?\n\u0007\t\n\u0007ii\t \u0007How would you deal with this result when drawing \nthe line of best fit?\n\u0007\t\n\u0007iii\t \u0007Give a possible explanation for the Cu2O \nresult obtained.\n\nSummary\n ■ The following table summarises the breakdown of skills and the marks allocated to each skill area as it is assessed \nin the Cambridge International A Level Chemistry Planning, Analysis and Evaluation examination (Paper 5). \nSkill\nBreakdown of marks(a)\nPlanning\n12 marks \nDefining the problem \n4 marks \nAnalysis, conclusions and evaluation \n12 marks \nDealing with data\n6 marks \n (a)The remaining 6 marks will be allocated across the skills in this grid and their allocation may vary from paper to paper.\nEnd-of-chapter question\n1 Diffusion in a gas is the random motion of particles involved in the net movement of a substance from an area \nof high concentration to an area of low concentration. The process of diffusion also takes place in solution. \nMedical scientists are interested in the rate of diffusion of pharmaceutical compounds through tumours. They \ncan model the factors that affect the rate of diffusion of these drugs by conducting investigations using coloured \ncompounds (to model the drugs) and gelatin, a jelly-like substance (to model the tumours).\nThe kinetic energy of particles depends on their mass and the speed they travel at. So at a given temperature, \nlarge particles will travel slower on average than smaller particles.\nImagine that you are a member of a research team trying to find out how the rate of diffusion through gelatin \ndepends on the relative molecular mass (Mr) of a drug.\n a i \n Predict how you think that the rate of diffusion will be affected as the relative molecular mass of a drug \nincreases.

These have relative molecular \nmasses of 486, 534, 686, 792 and 886, respectively. You are also provided with a stopclock/watch and a ruler \nwith a millimetre scale. You can also use any other common laboratory apparatus needed to complete the \ninvestigation. The diffusion is a slow process and the team carry out some trial runs to get a rough idea how \nquickly the dyes diffuse through the gelatin. They decide to monitor the experiment for 72 hours.\n Describe how you would carry out the experiment, making sure that you include how to:\n■ ensure the same number of dye molecules is used in each test\n■ ensure that the Petri dish is kept under the same conditions throughout all of the experiments\n ■ measure the rate of diffusion\n■ produce reliable results. \n[6]\n d Two of the dyes are classified as ‘harmful’ and are hazardous if absorbed through the skin or are inhaled. \nState any precautions you would take to minimise the risk. \n[2]\n e Draw a table with headings that show clearly the data you would record when carrying out your \nexperiments and any values you would need to calculate in order to construct a graph to check your \nprediction in part a.
