  "comprehensive_notes": {
    "introduction": "Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same proton number but different nucleon numbers. This variance arises due to a difference in the number of neutrons in the nucleus, resulting in atoms that are chemically identical but physically distinct in terms of mass and density.",
    "key_concepts": [
      {
        "concept": "Definition of Isotopes",
        "explanation": "Isotopes are defined as atoms of the same element which possess the same number of protons (and electrons in a neutral atom) but differ in the number of neutrons. Consequently, they share the same proton number (Z) but have different nucleon numbers (A).",
        "examples": [
          "Hydrogen-1 (Protium): 1 proton, 0 neutrons",
          "Hydrogen-2 (Deuterium): 1 proton, 1 neutron",

        ]
      },
      {
        "concept": "Isotopic Notation",
        "explanation": "Isotopes are represented using the notation A over Z followed by the chemical symbol (X), or A_Z X. Here, A represents the nucleon (mass) number, and Z represents the proton (atomic) number. They can also be named by the element followed by the nucleon number.",
        "examples": [
          "Boron-11 is written as: ¹¹B (with 5 as the proton number subscript)",
          "Chlorine-35 vs Chlorine-37"
        ]

      {
        "concept": "Properties of Isotopes",
        "explanation": "Isotopes exhibit identical chemical properties due to having the same electronic configuration. However, they exhibit distinct physical properties, specifically mass and density, due to the difference in nuclear mass.",
        "examples": [
          "Chemical: Both Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 react with Oxygen to form CO₂ in the same way.",
          "Physical: Deuterium (Hydrogen-2) is denser than Protium (Hydrogen-1)."

        "heading": "Atomic Structure and Notation",
        "content": "The fundamental distinction between isotopes lies in the nucleus. The proton number (Z) determines the element's identity and position in the Periodic Table. The nucleon number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons. Since the proton number is constant for a specific element, any variation in the nucleon number A is strictly due to the number of neutrons.",

        "heading": "Chemical Properties",
        "content": "Chemical behavior is dictated by the electronic structure of an atom, specifically the number and arrangement of electrons in the outer (valence) shell. Since isotopes of the same element have the same number of protons, neutral atoms of these isotopes also possess the same number of electrons arranged in the exact same configuration.",

          "Isotopes have the same number of electrons.",
          "Isotopes have identical electronic configurations.",

      "section_3": {
        "heading": "Physical Properties",
        "content": "While chemically identical, isotopes differ in properties that depend on the mass of the atom. The presence of extra neutrons increases the mass of the nucleus without affecting the charge. This results in observable differences in mass-dependent properties.",
        "key_points": [
          "Mass: Isotopes with more neutrons are heavier.",
          "Density: Heavier isotopes result in higher density for the substance.",
          "Syllabus Limitation: Explanations of physical property differences are limited to mass and density.",
          "Note: Neutrons add mass but do not carry charge, so they do not influence electronic interactions."

        "heading": "Calculating Particles in Isotopes and Ions",
        "content": "The number of neutrons can be calculated by rearranging the nucleon number formula: Number of neutrons = Nucleon number (A) - Proton number (Z). For ions, the number of electrons differs from the proton number depending on the charge.",

    "summary": "Isotopes are atoms defined by identical proton counts but varying neutron counts. This structural difference results in different nucleon numbers (masses). Consequently, while isotopes behave identically in chemical reactions due to unchanged electron configurations, they possess different physical properties such as mass and density. The standard notation places the nucleon number as a superscript and the proton number as a subscript before the element symbol.",
    "exam_tips": [
      "When defining isotopes, always mention BOTH 'same number of protons' and 'different number of neutrons'.",
      "Do not confuse nucleon number (mass) with proton number (atomic number). Remember A is always the larger number (except for Hydrogen-1 where they are equal).",
