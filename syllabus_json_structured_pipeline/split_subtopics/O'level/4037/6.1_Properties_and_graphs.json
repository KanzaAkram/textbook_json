Understand that f(x) = eˣ and g(x) = ln x are each the inverse of the other. Understand the asymptotic nature of the graphs of logarithmic and exponential functions. State the equations of any asymptotes. Graphs are limited to y = keⁿˣ + a and y = k ln(ax + b) where n, k, a and b are integers. Series expansions are not required.)"
