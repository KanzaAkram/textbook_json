        "description": "understand and use the terms optically active and racemic mixture"

        "description": "describe the effect on plane polarised light of the two optical isomers of a single substance"
      },
      {
        "objective_number": 4,
        "description": "explain the relevance of chirality to the synthetic preparation of drug molecules including: (a) the potential different biological activity of the two enantiomers (b) the need to separate a racemic mixture into two pure enantiomers (c) the use of chiral catalysts to produce a single pure optical isomer (Candidates should appreciate that compounds can contain more than one chiral centre, but knowledge of meso compounds and nomenclature such as diastereoisomers is not required.)"
