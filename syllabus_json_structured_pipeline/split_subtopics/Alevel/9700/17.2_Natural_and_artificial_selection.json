        "objective_number": 1,
        "description": "explain that natural selection occurs because populations have the capacity to produce many offspring that compete for resources; in the 'struggle for existence', individuals that are best adapted are most likely to survive to reproduce and pass on their alleles to the next generation"

        "objective_number": 3,
        "description": "explain how selection, the founder effect and genetic drift, including the bottleneck effect, may affect allele frequencies in populations"

        "objective_number": 4,

        "objective_number": 5,
        "description": "use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to calculate allele and genotype frequencies in populations and state the conditions when this principle can be applied (the two equations for the Hardy-Weinberg principle will be provided, as shown in the Mathematical requirements)"

        "description": "outline the following examples of selective breeding: the introduction of disease resistance to varieties of wheat and rice; inbreeding and hybridisation to produce vigorous, uniform varieties of maize; improving the milk yield of dairy cattle"
