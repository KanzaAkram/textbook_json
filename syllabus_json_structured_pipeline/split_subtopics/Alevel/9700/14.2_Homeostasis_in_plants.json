        "objective_number": 1,
        "description": "explain that stomata respond to changes in environmental conditions by opening and closing and that regulation of stomatal aperture balances the need for carbon dioxide uptake by diffusion with the need to minimise water loss by transpiration"

        "objective_number": 2,
        "description": "explain that stomata have daily rhythms of opening and closing"
      },
      {
        "objective_number": 3,
        "description": "describe the structure and function of guard cells and explain the mechanism by which they open and close stomata"
      },

        "objective_number": 4,
        "description": "describe the role of abscisic acid in the closure of stomata during times of water stress, including the role of calcium ions as a second messenger"
