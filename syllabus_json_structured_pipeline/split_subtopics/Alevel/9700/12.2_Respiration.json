      {
        "objective_number": 1,
        "description": "State where each of the four stages in aerobic respiration occurs in eukaryotic cells: glycolysis in the cytoplasm; link reaction in the mitochondrial matrix; Krebs cycle in the mitochondrial matrix; oxidative phosphorylation on the inner membrane of mitochondria"
      },
      {
        "objective_number": 2,
        "description": "outline glycolysis as phosphorylation of glucose and the subsequent splitting of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (6C) into two triose phosphate molecules (3C), which are then further oxidised to pyruvate (3C), with the production of ATP and reduced NAD"
      },
      {
        "objective_number": 3,
        "description": "explain that, when oxygen is available, pyruvate enters mitochondria to take part in the link reaction"
      },
      {
        "objective_number": 4,
        "description": "describe the link reaction, including the role of coenzyme A in the transfer of acetyl (2C) groups"
      },
      {
        "objective_number": 5,
        "description": "outline the Krebs cycle, explaining that oxaloacetate (4C) acts as an acceptor of the 2C fragment from acetyl coenzyme A to form citrate (6C), which is converted back to oxaloacetate in a series of small steps"
      },
      {
        "objective_number": 6,
        "description": "explain that reactions in the Krebs cycle involve decarboxylation and dehydrogenation and the reduction of the coenzymes NAD and FAD"

      },
      {
        "objective_number": 8,
        "description": "explain that during oxidative phosphorylation: hydrogen atoms split into protons and energetic electrons; energetic electrons release energy as they pass through the electron transport chain (details of carriers are not expected); the released energy is used to transfer protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane; protons return to the mitochondrial matrix by facilitated diffusion through ATP synthase, providing energy for ATP synthesis (details of ATP synthase are not expected); oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor to form water"

      {
        "objective_number": 9,

        "objective_number": 10,

      {
        "objective_number": 11,
        "description": "explain why the energy yield from respiration in aerobic conditions is much greater than the energy yield from respiration in anaerobic conditions (a detailed account of the total yield of ATP from the aerobic respiration of glucose is not expected)"

      {
        "objective_number": 12,
        "description": "explain how rice is adapted to grow with its roots submerged in water, limited to the development of aerenchyma in roots, ethanol fermentation in roots and faster growth of stems"

        "objective_number": 13,
