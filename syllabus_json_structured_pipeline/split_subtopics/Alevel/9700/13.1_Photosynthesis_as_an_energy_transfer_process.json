        "description": "explain that during photophosphorylation: energetic electrons release energy as they pass through the electron transport chain (details of carriers are not expected); the released energy is used to transfer protons across the thylakoid membrane; protons return to the stroma from the thylakoid space by facilitated diffusion through ATP synthase, providing energy for ATP synthesis (details of ATP synthase are not expected)"
