        "description": "understand the gradient of a curve at a point as the limit of the gradients of a suitable sequence of chords, and use the notations f'(x), f''(x), dy/dx and d²y/dx² for first and second derivatives",
        "notes_and_examples": "Only an informal understanding of the idea of a limit is expected. e.g. includes consideration of the gradient of the chord joining the points with x coordinates 2 and (2 + h) on the curve y = x³. Formal use of the general method of differentiation from first principles is not required."

        "description": "use the derivative of xⁿ (for any rational n), together with constant multiples, sums and differences of functions, and of composite functions using the chain rule",

        "description": "apply differentiation to gradients, tangents and normals, increasing and decreasing functions and rates of change",
