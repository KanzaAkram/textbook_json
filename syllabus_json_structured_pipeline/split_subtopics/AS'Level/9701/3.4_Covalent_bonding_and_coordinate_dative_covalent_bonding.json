        "objective_number": 2,
        "description": "(a) describe covalent bonds in terms of orbital overlap giving σ and π bonds: σ bonds are formed by direct overlap of orbitals between the bonding atoms; π bonds are formed by the sideways overlap of adjacent p orbitals above and below the σ bond (b) describe how the σ and π bonds form in molecules including H₂, C₂H₆, C₂H₄, HCN and N₂ (c) use the concept of hybridisation to describe sp, sp² and sp³ orbitals"

        "description": "(a) define the terms: bond energy as the energy required to break one mole of a particular covalent bond in the gaseous state; bond length as the internuclear distance of two covalently bonded atoms (b) use bond energy values and the concept of bond length to compare the reactivity of covalent molecules"
